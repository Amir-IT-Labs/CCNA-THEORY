🧾 What is VLSM?
VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) is a technique that allows you to create subnets of different sizes from a single IP block — based on the exact number of hosts needed in each subnet.

🔹 Unlike FLSM, where all subnets are equal in size,
🔹 VLSM gives you flexibility and helps you save IP addresses.

🧠 Why Use VLSM?
Let’s say you have these departments in a company:

| Department | Hosts Needed |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Admin      | 100          |
| HR         | 50           |
| IT Support | 25           |
| Security   | 10           |


If you use FLSM, all departments would get the same subnet size (e.g., all get 126 usable IPs), which wastes many addresses.

But with VLSM, you give each department only what they need, reducing waste.

📌 Key Formula for Host Calculation
To calculate how many IPs are needed:

2^n - 2 ≥ number of hosts

n = number of host bits

Example: Need 100 hosts

2^7 = 128 → 128 - 2 = 126 usable IPs → n = 7


🧮 VLSM Step-by-Step Example
Let’s assume you are given:

IP Block: 192.168.1.0/24

Need to divide into 4 subnets:

Subnet A: 100 hosts

Subnet B: 50 hosts

Subnet C: 25 hosts

Subnet D: 10 hosts

✅ Step 1: Sort Subnets by Host Size (largest to smallest)

| Subnet | Hosts Needed | Required Size   |
| ------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| A      | 100          | /25 (126 hosts) |
| B      | 50           | /26 (62 hosts)  |
| C      | 25           | /27 (30 hosts)  |
| D      | 10           | /28 (14 hosts)  |


✅ Step 2: Assign Subnets from the main block
Start with 192.168.1.0/24

| Subnet | Network Address | CIDR | Usable Range                  | Broadcast     |
| ------ | --------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| A      | 192.168.1.0     | /25  | 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.126   | 192.168.1.127 |
| B      | 192.168.1.128   | /26  | 192.168.1.129 – 192.168.1.190 | 192.168.1.191 |
| C      | 192.168.1.192   | /27  | 192.168.1.193 – 192.168.1.222 | 192.168.1.223 |
| D      | 192.168.1.224   | /28  | 192.168.1.225 – 192.168.1.238 | 192.168.1.239 |


Leftover IPs: 192.168.1.240 – 192.168.1.255 → (Reserved or used later)

📋 Summary of Terms

| Term                 | Meaning                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| VLSM                 | Variable Length Subnet Masking (different size subnets) |
| CIDR                 | Classless Inter-Domain Routing (like /24, /26, etc.)    |
| Efficient Subnetting | Only allocate needed IPs — saves addresses              |


✅ Advantages of VLSM
Saves IP addresses

Flexible design

Ideal for modern networks

Great for hierarchical routing

❌ Disadvantages
More complex than FLSM

Requires careful planning

Risk of overlapping subnets if not handled properly

🧠 Quick Practice:
You're given 10.0.0.0/24 and need:

1 subnet for 100 hosts

1 subnet for 50 hosts

1 subnet for 10 hosts.
