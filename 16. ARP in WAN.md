🧾 ARP in WAN – Complete Notes (Simplified for CCNA Level)

📌 What is ARP?

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network (LAN).

When a device knows the IP address of another device, but not its MAC address, it sends an ARP Request to find out. The target device replies with its MAC address.

📢 ARP uses Layer 2 broadcast:

Destination MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
Message: "Who has IP 192.168.1.1? Tell 192.168.1.10"

🔒 This broadcast stays only within the local network. It doesn’t cross routers.

🌐 ARP in WAN – Does It Work the Same?

No. ARP behaves differently in WANs, because most WAN links are not broadcast-enabled like LANs.

Routers use ARP only to resolve the next-hop MAC address on directly connected Ethernet interfaces. If the link is point-to-point (like serial), ARP is not used.

🧠 ARP Basics Recap

Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link)

Works via broadcasting to all devices in a LAN

Used to resolve IP → MAC

Does not work across routers or remote networks

🛜 When is ARP Used in WAN?

✅ 1. Ethernet-based WAN (e.g., Metro Ethernet, broadband)

Works like a LAN

Router sends ARP Request to next-hop router to resolve MAC address

❌ 2. Serial Point-to-Point WAN (PPP, HDLC)

No ARP needed

Link connects only 2 routers

Router sends packet directly — no need to resolve MAC

❌ 3. Older WANs (Frame Relay, MPLS, ATM)

These don’t use Ethernet or MAC addresses

Use special Layer 2 identifiers:

Frame Relay uses DLCI

MPLS uses labels

ATM uses VPI/VCI

ARP is not used

🔁 What Happens When Device in Network A Talks to Device in Network B?

📶 Example Topology:

[PC1]--SW1--R1--R2/R3--R4--SW2--[PC2]

✔️ Step-by-Step Process:

PC1 wants to send data to PC2 (different network)

PC1 checks: "Is 192.168.2.10 in my subnet?"

❌ No → Forward to default gateway (R1)

PC1 sends ARP Request for R1’s MAC address

R1 replies → PC1 sends packet to R1

R1 checks routing table:

Finds 2 equal-cost paths: via R2 and R3

Uses ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)

R1 selects one next-hop router (say R2)

If R1–R2 is Ethernet: R1 sends ARP to R2

If R1–R2 is Serial: No ARP needed

Packet arrives at R4

R4 checks: "Is 192.168.2.10 in my directly connected network?"

✅ Yes → Sends ARP to find PC2’s MAC

PC2 replies → Packet delivered

⚖️ Equal-Cost Multi-Path Routing (ECMP)

When a router has 2 or more equal-cost routes to a destination

Router uses load balancing:

Per-packet (rare)

Per-destination or per-flow (default)

ARP is performed only for the selected next-hop IP

Router does not ARP for both next hops

🚫 Do Routers ARP for Remote Devices?

No. Routers only ARP for next-hop IPs on directly connected networks.
They do not send ARP broadcasts for devices in remote subnets.

🔇 ARP Broadcasts Do Not Cross WAN or Routers

Case

ARP Broadcast Allowed?

Reason

LAN

✅ Yes

Broadcast stays within the local subnet

WAN (Ethernet-based)

✅ Yes (local only)

Used to resolve MAC of directly connected next-hop

WAN (PPP/Serial)

❌ No

Point-to-point link; no MAC needed

Router-to-Router (Ethernet)

✅ Maybe

Only if link is Ethernet

Remote Device

❌ No

ARP broadcast does not leave local network

❓ Why Switch MAC Address Is Not Used?

In a path like this:

PC1 -- SW1 -- R1 ........ R4 -- SW2 -- PC2

You might wonder: Why doesn't the switch's MAC appear in ARP?

🎯 Answer:

Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)

They do not have IP addresses for forwarding user data

They are transparent to ARP

Their job is to forward Ethernet frames based on MAC address tables

Switches do not generate or reply to ARP requests. They simply pass them along.

🧠 Think of switches like mail sorters:

They see the envelope (MAC address)

Sort it to the right output port

But they don’t put their name on the envelope or reply to it

Only routers, PCs, servers, and Layer 3 devices are involved in ARP.

🧾 Summary Points

Concept

Key Idea

ARP in LAN

Broadcast used to find MAC addresses

ARP in WAN

Only used on Ethernet-type links; not used on point-to-point or virtual

Routers and ARP

Only ARP for directly connected next-hop IPs

Equal-cost paths (ECMP)

Router picks one path and ARPs for that next-hop

Switches and ARP

Switches don’t participate in ARP; they forward frames invisibly

ARP broadcast limitations

ARP broadcasts do not cross routers or leave the local subnet.


🧠 When ARP is done in a WAN (like Ethernet-based WAN):
If a router performs an ARP request to reach the next-hop IP (on a directly connected WAN interface), here's what happens:

✅ Does the Router Store the MAC Address?
Yes, the router stores the result of the ARP request in its ARP table (also called the MAC address table or neighbor cache).

Example:

R1# show ip arp
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  192.168.100.1    0          00a1.b2c3.d4e5  ARPA   Gig0/0


🔁 Will the Router Send ARP Again Next Time?
🔹 1. No (immediately):
If the MAC address is already cached, the router will not send another ARP request. It will use the stored MAC address to forward the packet.

🔹 2. Yes (later):
The ARP entry has a timeout (usually 4 hours on Cisco, or 20 minutes on PCs).

If no traffic happens for a while, the entry expires.

Next time communication is needed, the router will send a new ARP request.

🧪 Real-World Scenario:
First communication:
R1 needs to send a packet to 192.168.100.1
→ Sends ARP request → learns MAC → stores in ARP table.

Second packet (within ARP timeout):
R1 sends it directly using the stored MAC.

After timeout or reboot:
R1 sends ARP request again to refresh the MAC address.

| Will it send ARP request again every time?   | ❌ No, only if the ARP entry expires or is cleared        |
| How long is the ARP entry stored?            | Depends on OS/device; Cisco default is usually   4 hours   |
| What if MAC changes (e.g., router replaced)? | New ARP request will discover the updated MAC              |
