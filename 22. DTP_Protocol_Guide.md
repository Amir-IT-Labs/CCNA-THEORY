# üåê Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) - Cisco Switching Concepts

## üìò Introduction

DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows Cisco switches to dynamically determine their interface status (Access or Trunk) without manual configuration.  
DTP is enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces.  
It is a proprietary protocol, which is why it is only enabled by default on Cisco switches.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands

```
switchport mode access
switchport mode trunk
```

---

## üîê Security

For security purposes, manual configuration is recommended.  
DTP should be disabled on all switches because DTP can be exploited by attackers.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands for DTP

```
switchport mode dynamic auto
switchport mode dynamic desirable
```

---

## ü§ù Dynamic Desirable Mode

A switch port in dynamic desirable mode will actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches.  
It will form a trunk if connected to another switch port in the following modes:

```
switchport mode trunk
switchport mode dynamic desirable
switchport mode dynamic auto
```

---

## üîç View Interface Mode

To check the mode of an interface, use the command:

```
show interface g0/0 switchport
```

---

## ü§ù Dynamic Auto Mode

A switch port in dynamic auto mode will not actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches.  
However, it will form a trunk if the switch connected to it is actively trying to form a trunk.  
It will form a trunk with a switch port in the following modes:

```
switchport mode trunk 
switchport mode dynamic desirable
```

---

## üö´ Non-Switch Devices

DTP will not form a trunk with a router or PC.  
The switch port will be in access mode.  
If we want to configure router-on-a-stick, we must manually configure the switch port as trunk:

```
switchport mode trunk
```

---

## üßì Default Modes

On older switches, the default administrative mode is:

```
switchport mode dynamic desirable
```

On newer switches, the default administrative mode is:

```
switchport mode dynamic auto
```

---

## ‚ùå Disable DTP Negotiation

We can disable DTP negotiation on an interface with this command:

```
switchport nonegotiate
```

If we use this command, the switch port will not send DTP negotiation frames on that port.

Configuring an access port with:

```
switchport mode access
```

also disables DTP negotiation on that interface.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

It is recommended that you disable DTP on all switch ports and manually configure them as either access or trunk ports.

---

## üîÑ Encapsulation Negotiation

Switches that support both 802.1Q and ISL trunk encapsulations can use DTP to negotiate the encapsulation they will use.

This negotiation is enabled by default, and the default trunk encapsulation mode is:

```
switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate
```

ISL is favored over 802.1Q, so if both switches support ISL, it will be selected.

---

## üì° DTP Frame Transmission

DTP frames are sent in VLAN 1 when using ISL,  
or in the native VLAN when using 802.1Q (the default native VLAN is VLAN 1, however).
