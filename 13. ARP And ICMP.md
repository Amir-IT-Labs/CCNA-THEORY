🔹 What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?
🧠 Basic Concept:
Devices on a network use IP addresses to communicate at Layer 3 (Network Layer).

But to actually send the data over Ethernet, they need MAC addresses, which work at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).

ARP helps convert an IP address into a MAC address, so data can be delivered correctly on a local network.

🔧 How ARP Works:
🔁 1. ARP Request
Sent when a device knows the IP address but does not know the MAC address.

This message is sent as a broadcast, meaning all devices on the network receive it.

The message is basically:
➡️ “Who has this IP address? Please tell me your MAC address.”

✅ 2. ARP Reply
The device with the matching IP responds with its MAC address.

This reply is sent as a unicast (direct reply to the sender).

🧾 Command to View ARP Table
You can view the ARP table using:


arp -a

This command works on:

Windows

macOS

Linux

📚 Types of ARP Table Entries:

| Entry Type  | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|   Dynamic   | Learned automatically by the ARP process  |
|   Static    | Manually added by a user or administrator |


🧠 Quick Reference:

| Layer   | Term        | Used For                                  |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Layer 3 | IP Address  | Identifies devices across networks        |
| Layer 2 | MAC Address | Identifies devices inside a local network |
| -       | ARP         | Connects IP to MAC                        |


📶 Understanding ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
📩 ICMP is used for:
Testing connectivity between devices

Diagnosing network issues (e.g., with the ping command)

ICMP works after ARP has resolved the MAC address. Once the destination MAC is known, the actual message (like a ping) can be sent.

🔄 Switch Behavior – Learning & Forwarding
When a device sends a message using Ethernet, the switch decides how to forward that frame.

🚨 1. Unknown Unicast (Flooding):
If the switch does not know the destination MAC address:

It sends (floods) the frame to all connected ports.

This is called unknown unicast flooding.

✅ 2. Known Unicast (Efficient Forwarding):
Once the switch has learned which MAC address is on which port (through ARP or ICMP replies):

It sends frames only to the correct port.

This is much more efficient and reduces unnecessary traffic.

Switches automatically learn MAC addresses by observing incoming traffic.

💡 Why This Matters:
ARP ensures correct delivery of data by mapping IPs to MACs.

ICMP helps verify communication between devices.

Switches optimize traffic flow after learning MAC addresses.

Together, ARP + ICMP + switching behavior make LAN communication reliable and efficient.

| Concept             | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|   ARP               | Converts IP ➝ MAC for local delivery         |
|   ARP Request       | Broadcast asking for MAC address             |
|   ARP Reply         | Unicast response with MAC address            |
|   ICMP              | Tests connection (e.g., ping)                |
|   Unknown Unicast   | Frame sent to all ports until MAC is learned |
|   Known Unicast     | Frame sent only to the correct port          |
