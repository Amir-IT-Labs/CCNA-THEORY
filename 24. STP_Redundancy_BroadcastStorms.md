# üõ°Ô∏è Network Redundancy, Broadcast Storms, and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) ‚Äì Full CCNA Notes

## üîÅ What is Redundancy?

Redundancy means **having backup paths or devices** in your network to avoid downtime. It is a **critical part of modern network design**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A network **without redundancy** is not acceptable in the real world because modern networks are expected to run **24/7/365**. Even a few seconds of downtime can seriously impact business operations.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:
- If one network component fails, others should **automatically take over**.
- Try to implement redundancy **at every possible point** in the network.
- Most **PCs have a single NIC**, so they can only connect to **one switch**.
- However, **important servers** often have **multiple NICs**, which are connected to **different switches** for backup.

## üå™Ô∏è Broadcast Storms in Layer 2

### ‚ùó Why Broadcast Storms Happen:

Ethernet **does not have a TTL (Time to Live)** field like IP packets. So:

- Broadcast frames **can loop around forever** if there is a **Layer 2 loop**.
- If too many of these looping frames build up, the network becomes **overloaded** ‚Äî this is called a **broadcast storm**.
- Legitimate traffic is unable to pass due to **congestion**.

### üß† MAC Address Flapping

Another issue during broadcast storms:

- Every time a frame is received, the switch updates its **MAC address table** using the source MAC and port.
- But if the **same MAC address** keeps coming in from **different interfaces**, the switch keeps changing the table.
- This behavior is called **MAC address flapping**.
- It causes confusion and traffic loss in the switch.

---

## üå≥ Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

STP is the **solution** to broadcast storms and Layer 2 loops.

### üìö Overview:
- Standard STP is defined by **IEEE 802.1D**.
- All Cisco switches have **STP enabled by default**.
- STP prevents loops by **blocking** some ports and allowing only **one active path** between devices.

### üîÑ Forwarding vs Blocking Ports

- Ports in **forwarding state** send and receive normal traffic.
- Ports in **blocking state** do **not forward normal traffic**, but can send/receive **STP BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units)**.

---

## üëë STP Election: Root Bridge

### What is the Bridge ID?

A **Bridge ID** is used to elect the root switch. It contains:

- **Bridge Priority** (16 bits)
- **MAC Address** (48 bits)

> By default, the **Bridge Priority** is **32768** on all switches. So the switch with the **lowest MAC address** becomes the **Root Bridge**.

### üîß Extended System ID

Cisco switches include VLAN information in the Bridge ID:

- Bridge Priority = 4 bits
- **Extended System ID = VLAN ID** (12 bits)
- The total Bridge ID includes both

> You can only change Bridge Priority in units of **4096** (the value of the least significant bit).

### üî¢ Valid Bridge Priority Values:
```
0, 4096, 8192, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, 61440
```

## üì¨ STP BPDU Messages

- Switches send a **Hello BPDU** out of **all interfaces every 2 seconds**.
- If a switch receives a Hello BPDU on a port, it knows that **another switch** is connected on the other end (not a PC or router).
- Initially, every switch **thinks it is the Root Bridge**, but will surrender if it receives a **superior BPDU** (a lower Bridge ID).

### After Convergence:
- Only the **Root Bridge** generates BPDUs.
- Other switches just **forward** them ‚Äî they don‚Äôt create new ones.

---

## üîß Port Roles in STP

### 1. **Designated Port (DP)**
- The **best port** on a segment (collision domain).
- Always in **forwarding** state.
- One DP per segment.

### 2. **Root Port (RP)**
- The **best path** from a switch to the Root Bridge.
- One RP per switch.
- Always in **forwarding** state.

### 3. **Non-Designated Port**
- These ports are in the **blocking** state to prevent loops.

## üìä STP Cost (Root Path Cost)

Each switch calculates the cost to reach the Root Bridge. Lower cost = better path.

| Link Speed | STP Cost |
|------------|----------|
| 10 Mbps    | 100      |
| 100 Mbps   | 19       |
| 1 Gbps     | 4        |
| 10 Gbps    | 2        |

## üîÅ STP Election & Port Selection Process

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step:

#### 1. **Root Bridge Election**
- Switch with the **lowest Bridge ID** becomes the Root Bridge.
- All ports on the Root Bridge are **Designated Ports (DP)**.

#### 2. **Root Port Selection**
- Each non-root switch selects one port as its **Root Port (RP)**.
- Selection rules:
  1. **Lowest total root cost**
  2. If tied ‚Üí **lowest Bridge ID of neighbor**
  3. If still tied ‚Üí **lowest Port ID**

#### 3. **Designated Port Election**
- For each collision domain:
  - Switch with **lowest cost** to root bridge has the **Designated Port**.
  - If tied, switch with **lower Bridge ID** wins.
  - The **other switch** sets its port to **blocking** (Non-Designated).

## üåê Cisco-Specific: PVST (Per-VLAN Spanning Tree)

- Cisco uses **PVST**, which runs **a separate STP instance per VLAN**.
- This allows **different STP topologies for each VLAN**.
- Helps with **load balancing** and **better traffic management**.

---

## üß† Final Notes

- Redundancy is **essential** but must be **controlled** to avoid loops.
- **STP prevents loops** by putting extra ports into a **blocking state**.
- **Broadcast storms and MAC flapping** are serious Layer 2 issues caused by loops.
- Understanding **STP logic and port roles** is critical for designing reliable Layer 2 networks.
