# 🔹 What is an IP Address?

An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a **unique number assigned to every device** in a network.  
It acts like a **home address**, helping devices know where to send and receive data.

💡 Without IP addresses, computers wouldn’t be able to find or communicate with each other.

## 🧠 IP Address Basics

- Works at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model
- Enables **routing from source to destination**
- Two versions:
  - IPv4 – Most commonly used (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
  - IPv6 – Newer format with more address space

---

## 🌐 IPv4 – Internet Protocol Version 4

- Written as **four numbers separated by dots**  
  ➤ Example: `192.168.1.1`
- Each number ranges from **0 to 255**
- Total size: **32 bits = ~4.3 billion unique addresses**

## 🔎 Structure of an IPv4 Address

| Part            | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Network Portion | Identifies which network the device belongs to |
| Host Portion    | Identifies the specific device on that network |

🏙️ **Example Analogy**:  
`City name` = Network portion  
`House number` = Host portion

## 🏠 Private IP Addresses

Used **within local networks** (homes, offices, schools).  
They **cannot be accessed directly** from the internet.

| Range                        | Common Use         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255   | Large networks     |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 | Medium networks    |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | Home/small networks |

💡 Routers use **NAT (Network Address Translation)** to convert private IPs into public ones when sending data to the internet.

## 🌍 Public IP Addresses

- Used to **identify devices on the internet**
- **Globally unique** – Assigned by your **ISP**
- Allow communication across the global internet

## 🔄 Static vs Dynamic IPs

| Type       | Description                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Static IP  | Manually assigned, doesn't change             |
| Dynamic IP | Automatically assigned via DHCP, can change   |

Most home users receive **dynamic IPs** from their ISP.

## 🎯 Types of IPv4 Communication

| Type       | Description                                | Example                             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Unicast    | One-to-one communication                    | Sending a message to a friend       |
| Broadcast  | One-to-all (IPv4 only)                      | Asking "Who has IP 192.168.1.1?"    |
| Multicast  | One-to-many (specific group of devices)     | Streaming a live video to viewers   |

- **Broadcast Address**: `255.255.255.255`
- **Multicast Range**: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255`

## 📚 IP Address Classes (Legacy)

| Class | Range                         | Usage              |
|-------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255     | Very large networks |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255   | Medium networks     |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255   | Small networks      |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255   | Multicast           |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255   | Research/testing    |

⚠️ Today we use **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** instead of these classes.

## 📏 Subnet Mask – What Is It?

A **subnet mask** splits the IP into **network and host parts**.

🧪 Example:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0


- First 3 numbers (`192.168.1`) = Network
- Last number (`.10`) = Host (device on the network)

## 🧾 Important IP Terms Recap

| Term            | Meaning                                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| IP Address      | Unique number for each device on a network       |
| IPv4            | 32-bit dotted-decimal format (e.g., `192.168.0.1`) |
| IPv6            | 128-bit hex format (e.g., `2001:abcd::1`)        |
| Public IP       | Used on the internet (globally routable)         |
| Private IP      | Used inside local networks (not internet-facing) |
| Unicast         | One-to-one communication                         |
| Broadcast       | One-to-all communication (IPv4 only)             |
| Multicast       | One-to-group communication                       |
| Subnet Mask     | Divides IP into network and host                 |
| Default Gateway | The device that connects a network to others     |

## ✅ Why IP Addressing Is Important

- Assigns **unique identity** to each device
- Enables **data routing** across networks
- Supports **different types of communication**
- Forms the **foundation of all internet/data exchange**
