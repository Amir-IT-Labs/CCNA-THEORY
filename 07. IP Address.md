🔹 What is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique number assigned to every device in a network. It acts like a home address that helps other devices know where to send data.

💡 Without IP addresses, computers wouldn’t know how to reach each other.

🧠 IP Address Basics:
Used in Layer 3 of the OSI Model (Network Layer)

Helps in routing data from source to destination

Two main versions: IPv4 and IPv6

1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
Most commonly used

Written as four numbers separated by dots
➤ Example: 192.168.1.1

Each number is from 0 to 255

Total size: 32 bits = about 4.3 billion unique addresses

🔎 Structure of an IPv4 Address
An IPv4 address has two parts:

Part	Purpose
Network Portion	Identifies which network the device belongs to
Host Portion	Identifies the specific device on that network

🏙️ Think of it like:
City name = Network portion
House number = Host portion

🏠 Private IP Addresses
Used within private/local networks like homes, schools, and offices.

They cannot be accessed directly from the internet.

| Range                           | Used in                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`     | Large private networks  |
| `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`   | Medium private networks |
| `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | Small/home networks     |

💡 Routers use NAT (Network Address Translation) to convert private IPs into public IPs when sending data to the internet.

🌐 Public IP Addresses
Used to identify devices on the internet

Must be unique globally

Assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP)

🔄 Static vs Dynamic IP Addresses

| Type           | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|   Static IP    | Manually set and does   not change               |
|   Dynamic IP   | Automatically assigned, can   change   over time |

Most users get dynamic IPs from their ISP via DHCP.

🎯 Types of IPv4 Communication Based on Addressing
✅ 1. Unicast Address
One-to-one communication

Data is sent from one sender to one receiver

Most common type of communication (like browsing a website)

📦 Example: Sending a message directly to a friend

📢 2. Broadcast Address
One-to-all communication

Data is sent to all devices on the same network

Only used in IPv4, not supported in IPv6

🔔 Example: Announcing “Who has IP 192.168.1.1?” to everyone in the room

IPv4 Broadcast address: 255.255.255.255

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 3. Multicast Address
One-to-many communication

Data is sent to a specific group of devices, not all

Used in streaming, online gaming, etc.

Ranges from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

🎥 Example: One video stream sent to many viewers at once

📚 IP Address Classes (Legacy Concept)
IPv4 addresses were traditionally divided into classes:

| Class | Range                         | Usage               |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| A     | `1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255`   | Very large networks |
| B     | `128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255` | Medium networks     |
| C     | `192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255` | Small networks      |
| D     | `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255` | Multicast           |
| E     | `240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255` | Research & Testing  |


⚠️ Modern networks use CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) instead of relying on these classes.

📏 Subnet Mask – What Is It?
A subnet mask divides the IP address into network and host parts.

Example:

IP: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
➤ This means first 3 numbers (192.168.1) = network
➤ Last number (.10) = host (device ID)

🧾 Important IP Terms Recap

| Term            | Meaning                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| IP Address      | Unique number for a device on a network          |
| IPv4            | 32-bit, dotted format like 192.168.0.1           |
| IPv6            | 128-bit, colon-separated hex like 2001:...       |
| Public IP       | Used on the internet                             |
| Private IP      | Used inside local networks                       |
| Unicast         | One-to-one communication                         |
| Broadcast       | One-to-all communication (IPv4 only)             |
| Multicast       | One-to-many (group) communication                |
| Subnet Mask     | Defines network and host portion of IP           |
| Default Gateway | Path to reach other networks (like the internet) |


✅ Summary: Why IP Addressing Is Important
It gives each device a unique identity

It helps in sending and receiving data

It defines how data travels across networks

It supports efficient communication whether one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-all
