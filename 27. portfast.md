# Fast Port – The Problem

When an end host connects to a switch port, the port becomes **up/up** but **cannot send or receive data yet**.  
Even though it is a **designated port**, it will take **30 seconds** before it enters the **forwarding state**:

- **15 seconds** in the **Listening** state  
- **15 seconds** in the **Learning** state

This leads to a poor user experience.  
The user probably doesn't even know STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) exists.  
They just know:  
> "The internet does not work" for 30 seconds when they connect their computer.

This wait is **totally unnecessary**, because there is **no risk of a Layer 2 loop** occurring between a switch and an end device (like a PC).

## What is PortFast?

When **PortFast** is configured on a port, the port **immediately enters the Forwarding state** when connected to another device.  
It **bypasses the Listening and Learning states** and can send/receive data right away.

---

## How to Configure PortFast

You can configure PortFast in **two ways**:

### 1. Interface Configuration Mode

```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
```

### 2. Global Configuration Mode

```bash
SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast default
```

> This enables PortFast on **all access ports**.

Since connections between switches are **almost always trunk links**, and connections to end hosts are **almost always access links**, this is generally safe and recommended.

## Show PortFast Status

Command to display spanning-tree details for an interface:

```bash
show spanning-tree interface g0/1 detail
```

## Types of PortFast

There are two types of PortFast:

1. **Edge** – used for end devices (PCs, printers, etc.)  
2. **Network** – used in advanced setups (like Bridge Assurance) — *not a CCNA topic*

> We are covering the **Edge** type in CCNA.

## PortFast on Trunk Ports

In some special cases, you **may want to enable PortFast on a trunk port**, such as:

- A port connected to a **virtualization server** with **VMs in different VLANs**
- A port connected to a **router** (Router-on-a-Stick configuration)

> This must be configured **per-port** in **interface config mode**:

```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast trunk
```
