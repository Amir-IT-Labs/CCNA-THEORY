üìç What is Routing?
Routing is the process of choosing the best path for data (called IP packets) to travel across networks so that it reaches the correct destination (like a website or another computer).

Imagine you're sending a letter ‚Äî you drop it at your local post office, and they figure out the best route to send it so it reaches the destination. Routers do the same for your data.

Routers use a routing table, which is like a map or directory, to decide:

Where is the packet going?

What is the best way to send it there?

Which device should get it next?

üõ£ How does routing work (step-by-step)?
A packet arrives at the router.

The router looks inside its routing table to see if it knows how to reach the destination.

It chooses the best route (based on cost, speed, or priority).

The router sends the packet to the next stop (called the next-hop).

üîπ Types of Routing
1. Dynamic Routing
In dynamic routing, routers automatically share information with each other using routing protocols like:

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

These protocols help routers learn about network changes (like a new router being added or a link going down) and update their routing tables without human help.

Benefits:

Self-updating

Quick response to network changes

Drawbacks:

Uses more CPU and bandwidth

2. Static Routing
In static routing, the network administrator manually sets the routes. That means the router is told: "If you want to reach Network A, always send data through Router B."

Benefits:

More secure

Complete control over routes

No extra CPU/bandwidth usage

Drawbacks:

Doesn‚Äôt adapt automatically if the network changes

Requires manual updating

üìå What is a Route?
A route is just a set of instructions that tells a router:

‚ÄúIf the destination IP is X, send the packet to next-hop Y.‚Äù

The next-hop could be:

Another router (if the destination is far)

A directly connected device (if it‚Äôs in the same network)

The router itself (if the packet is for its own IP)

üß≠ Routing Table Codes (Used in show ip route)
When you check the routing table in a router (using the command show ip route), you'll see codes that tell how each route was learned. Here's what they mean:

| Code  | Meaning   | Explanation                                                |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|   L   | Local     | This is the router‚Äôs   own IP address  . (Used internally) |
|   C   | Connected | The router is   directly connected   to this network.      |
|   S   | Static    | The route was   manually added   by an admin.              |
|   O   | OSPF      | The route was learned using the   OSPF protocol  .         |
|   R   | RIP       | The route was learned using the   RIP protocol  .          |
|   D   | EIGRP     | The route was learned using the   EIGRP protocol  .        |


‚úÖ Summary
Routing helps packets find the best way to reach the destination.

Dynamic Routing = automatic, fast, self-updating

Static Routing = manual, secure, stable

Routing Table = the router‚Äôs map to decide where to send data

Route = instructions to reach a destination via a next-hop

Routing Codes show how routes were learned.
