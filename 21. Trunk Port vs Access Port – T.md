## üéØ Trunk Port vs Access Port ‚Äì Tagging, 802.1Q, and Ethernet Frame Details

---

### üì¶ Trunk Port = Tagged Port
- A **trunk port** is used to **carry traffic for multiple VLANs** between switches or between a switch and a router.
- It uses **802.1Q encapsulation** (also called **dot1q**) to **tag each Ethernet frame** with a VLAN ID.
- This VLAN tag ensures the receiving device knows **which VLAN the frame belongs to**.

üß™ For example:  
A trunk port can send frames for VLAN 10, 20, and 30 over **one cable** using tags like:

Frame 1 ‚Üí VLAN 10
Frame 2 ‚Üí VLAN 20
Frame 3 ‚Üí VLAN 30


Each frame includes a special **802.1Q tag** that identifies its VLAN.

---

### üì¶ Access Port = Untagged Port
- An **access port** is assigned to **only one VLAN**.
- It **does not tag** the frames ‚Äî traffic entering or leaving an access port is **untagged**.
- Access ports are used to connect **end devices** like PCs, printers, IP phones, etc.

üß™ Example:  
A PC connected to Fa0/1 (access port in VLAN 10) will send and receive **normal Ethernet frames**, with **no VLAN tag** attached.

### üß¨ 802.1Q (Dot1Q) VLAN Tagging Explained

**802.1Q** is the industry standard protocol used for VLAN tagging on Ethernet networks.

When a frame is sent out of a **trunk port**, a **4-byte VLAN tag** is inserted **inside the Ethernet frame header**.

### üìê Ethernet Frame Structure with 802.1Q Tag

| Field               | Size   | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Preamble**        | 7 Bytes | Synchronization bits |
| **SFD** (Start Frame Delimiter) | 1 Byte  | Indicates start of frame |
| **Destination MAC** | 6 Bytes | Destination MAC address |
| **Source MAC**      | 6 Bytes | Source MAC address |
| **802.1Q Tag**      | 4 Bytes | VLAN info (explained below) |
| **Type/Length**     | 2 Bytes | Type (e.g., IPv4 = 0x0800) |
| **Data**            | 46‚Äì1500 Bytes | Payload (e.g., IP packet) |
| **FCS**             | 4 Bytes | Frame Check Sequence (error checking) |

### üîç Inside the 802.1Q VLAN Tag (4 Bytes Total)

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **TPID** (Tag Protocol ID) | 2 Bytes | Always `0x8100` to identify dot1q |
| **TCI** (Tag Control Info) | 2 Bytes | Includes: |
| - Priority (3 bits) | - | QoS priority (0‚Äì7) |
| - CFI (1 bit)       | - | Canonical Format Indicator |
| - VLAN ID (12 bits) | - | Range: 1 to 4094 |

üìå The most important part here is the **VLAN ID**, which tells the switch which VLAN the frame belongs to.

### üßæ Summary

| Feature            | Access Port                  | Trunk Port                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| VLAN Membership     | One VLAN only                | Multiple VLANs                |
| Tagging             | **Untagged**                 | **Tagged using 802.1Q**       |
| Frame Type          | Standard Ethernet            | Ethernet + 802.1Q tag         |
| Use Case            | End devices (PCs, Printers)  | Switch-to-switch, Switch-Router |
| 802.1Q Encapsulation | ‚ùå Not used                  | ‚úÖ Used (dot1q)                |

---

‚úÖ **Remember:**  
- **Access Port = Untagged**  
- **Trunk Port = Tagged (802.1Q / dot1q)**  
- **802.1Q adds a 4-byte VLAN tag** between Source MAC and Type/Length in the Ethernet frame.

## üîπ What is a Native VLAN?

A **Native VLAN** is the VLAN that carries **untagged traffic** on a **trunk port** (a port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs).

By default, Cisco switches use **VLAN 1** as the native VLAN, but it's better to **change it** for security reasons.

---

### üß† Why Do We Need a Native VLAN?

- Most devices send **tagged traffic** with a VLAN ID.
- But some older devices or voice phones send **untagged traffic**.
- When untagged traffic comes to a **trunk port**, the switch puts it into the **Native VLAN**.

### üìå Important Points

| Feature           | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Default VLAN      | VLAN 1                                            |
| What it carries   | Untagged traffic on trunk links                   |
| Use case          | Helps older or simple devices communicate         |
| Security note     | VLAN 1 is risky ‚Äî use a separate, unused VLAN     |

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure Native VLAN on a Cisco Switch

1. Go to the interface (trunk port).
2. Set the port to trunk mode.
3. Set the native VLAN to another VLAN (like 99 or 999).

```bash
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# interface fa0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99
Switch(config-if)# exit
Switch# write memory

This makes VLAN 99 the native VLAN for port fa0/1.

üîç How to Check Native VLAN

Switch# show interface fa0/1 switchport

Look for this line:
Administrative Native VLAN: 99

üîê Security Tips
Don't use VLAN 1 as native VLAN.

Create a special VLAN (like VLAN 999) just for native traffic.

Don't assign any PCs or users to the native VLAN.

Use VLAN pruning to control which VLANs are allowed on trunk links.


‚úÖ Summary Table
| Setting              | Recommendation                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Native VLAN          | Use an unused VLAN (e.g. 99/999)  |
| Default Native VLAN  | VLAN 1 (change it for security)   |
| Works with           | Untagged traffic on trunk ports   |
| Command to configure | `switchport trunk native vlan 99` |
| Check native VLAN    | `show interface fa0/1 switchport` |

üìò Simple Example
You have two switches connected on port Gig0/1. You want to use VLAN 999 for native traffic.

Do this on both switches:

Switch(config)# interface gig0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 999

Now both ends will treat untagged traffic as part of VLAN 999 instead of VLAN 1.

‚úÖ This helps make your network more organized and secure.
