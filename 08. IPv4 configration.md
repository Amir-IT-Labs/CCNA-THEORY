🔹 What is IPv4 Configuration?
IPv4 configuration is the process of assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways to network devices so they can communicate over a network.

It also involves setting up router interfaces to ensure devices from different subnets can talk to each other.

🧠 Key Steps in IPv4 Configuration:
1. Access Router Privileged Mode
To begin configuration, the router must be in privileged mode:

enable


2. Enter Global Configuration Mode
This mode allows you to configure system-wide settings:

config terminal


🔧 Configure Router Interfaces
Each router interface must be:

Given an IP address

Assigned a subnet mask

Brought into an active state (enabled)

Example Command Format:
bash
Copy
Edit


interface [interface-name]
 description [optional-text]
 ip address [IP address] [Subnet mask]
 no shutdown

Explanation:

interface command selects the interface you want to configure (like G0/0)

description is optional — it helps to label the interface

ip address assigns the address and subnet mask

no shutdown turns the interface on (enabled)

Repeat this for every interface that connects to a different network/subnet.

3. Exit Interface Configuration Mode
To leave the interface setup:

exit


🧾 Verify Interface Configuration
After assigning IPs and enabling interfaces, check the status with:

✅ show ip interface brief
Shows summary of all interfaces

Displays IP addresses and their current status (up/down)

✅ show interface [interface-name]
Shows detailed information for one specific interface

Useful for troubleshooting speed, duplex, errors, etc.

📡 Purpose of These Configurations
🔹 Static IPv4 Assignment
Assigning IP addresses manually ensures full control of what IP is used where.

🔹 Subnet Mask Selection
Subnet masks define how many hosts and how many networks are allowed. Choose the correct one based on IP range and design.

🔹 Interface Activation
Routers keep interfaces off by default. Use no shutdown to activate them.

🔹 Inter-Network Connectivity
When multiple subnets exist, router interfaces must be configured properly to route data between them.

🛠️ Common Commands in IPv4 Configuration

| Command                   | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `enable`                  | Enter privileged EXEC mode              |
| `config terminal`         | Enter global configuration mode         |
| `interface [G0/0]`        | Select interface to configure           |
| `ip address [IP] [mask]`  | Assign IPv4 address and subnet mask     |
| `no shutdown`             | Enable the interface                    |
| `description [text]`      | Add a label to the interface (optional) |
| `exit`                    | Exit current configuration mode         |
| `show ip interface brief` | View IP and status of all interfaces    |
| `show interface [G0/0]`   | Detailed stats of a specific interface  |


🧠 Why IPv4 Configuration is Important
Ensures devices have valid IP addresses

Allows communication between different networks

Helps routers make decisions for packet forwarding

Enables manual control over addressing and design

Supports troubleshooting through interface visibility
