üîç What is an Ethernet Frame?
An Ethernet frame is the format used to send data across a local network. Before data is sent from one device to another, it is organized (encapsulated) into this frame.

The Ethernet frame includes:

Information about where the data is going (Destination MAC)

Where it‚Äôs coming from (Source MAC)

The actual data (Payload)

And extra information to check for errors

üîπ Ethernet Frame Parts (Overview)
An Ethernet frame is made of three main parts:

| Part        | What it does                                      | Size             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
|   Header    | Tells where the data is going and what kind it is | 14 bytes         |
|   Payload   | The actual data being sent                        | 46 to 1500 bytes |
|   Trailer   | Helps detect errors                               | 4 bytes          |


üîß Detailed Breakdown of Each Part
üî∏ 1. Preamble & SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)
These are always sent before every Ethernet frame.

Their job is to get the receiver ready to accept the frame.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: These are not part of the actual header, but are still necessary.

| Field        | Size    | Purpose                                                |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   Preamble   | 7 bytes | Synchronizes communication between sender and receiver |
|   SFD        | 1 byte  | Signals the start of the actual frame                  |


So, Preamble + SFD = 8 bytes, sent before the frame.

üî∏ 2. Ethernet Header (14 Bytes Total)
This is the official start of the Ethernet frame.

| Field               | Size    | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   Destination MAC   | 6 bytes | The MAC address of the device receiving the data                               |
|   Source MAC        | 6 bytes | The MAC address of the device sending the data                                 |
|   Type/Length       | 2 bytes | Tells what type of data is in the payload (like IPv4, IPv6), or how long it is |


‚úÖ Total size of the header: 6 + 6 + 2 = 14 bytes

üî∏ 3. Payload (Data)
This is the actual data being transmitted, like an IPv4 packet.

Ethernet requires that the minimum payload must be 46 bytes.

The maximum payload is usually 1500 bytes.

üìå Padding (if needed):
If the data is less than 46 bytes, padding is added.

Padding is just extra zeros to reach 46 bytes.

Example:
If your data is 36 bytes, then 10 bytes of padding is added.
36 + 10 = 46 bytes total payload.

üî∏ 4. Trailer ‚Äì FCS (Frame Check Sequence)

| Field   | Size    | Purpose                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   FCS   | 4 bytes | Detects if the data was **corrupted** during transmission using **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)** |


This helps the receiving device check if the data was received correctly.

If the FCS fails, the frame is dropped.

üìè Minimum Ethernet Frame Size: 64 Bytes
To ensure smooth communication, Ethernet requires a minimum frame size of 64 bytes, which includes:

| Part          | Size             |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Header        | 14 bytes         |
| Payload       | Minimum 46 bytes |
| Trailer (FCS) | 4 bytes          |

So, 14 + 46 + 4 = 64 bytes minimum size

If the data is too short, padding is added to reach this size.

‚úÖ Key Points to Remember:
The Ethernet frame is how data is sent in a local network.

The header contains MAC addresses and type/length info.

The payload is the actual data being sent.

The trailer (FCS) checks for errors in the data.

Preamble and SFD help start the communication but are not part of the main frame.

If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding is used to make sure the frame is at least 64 bytes.

This standard keeps communication reliable and devices working properly.
