# 🔍 What is an Ethernet Frame?

An **Ethernet frame** is the format used to send data across a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.  
Before data is sent from one device to another, it is organized (**encapsulated**) into this frame.

## 📦 What Does an Ethernet Frame Contain?

- **Destination MAC Address** → Where the data is going  
- **Source MAC Address** → Where the data is coming from  
- **Payload** → The actual data  
- **FCS (Trailer)** → Used to check for errors

## 🔹 Ethernet Frame Parts – Overview

| Part     | What It Does                              | Size              |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Header   | Destination/Source MAC + Type/Length Info  | 14 bytes          |
| Payload  | Actual data being sent                     | 46 to 1500 bytes  |
| Trailer  | Detects errors                             | 4 bytes           |

## 🔧 Detailed Breakdown of Each Part

---

### 🔸 1. Preamble & SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)

These fields **come before** the actual frame.  
They **prepare the receiving device** to accept the frame.

| Field     | Size     | Purpose                                           |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Preamble  | 7 bytes  | Synchronizes communication between sender/receiver |
| SFD       | 1 byte   | Signals the start of the frame                    |

🧠 **Note**: Preamble + SFD = 8 bytes (not part of the main frame, but always sent)

---

### 🔸 2. Ethernet Header (14 Bytes)

The actual start of the Ethernet frame.  
Contains addressing and type/length information.

| Field             | Size     | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Destination MAC  | 6 bytes  | MAC address of the **receiving** device      |
| Source MAC       | 6 bytes  | MAC address of the **sending** device        |
| Type / Length    | 2 bytes  | Type of payload (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) or length |

✅ **Total Header Size** = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14 bytes

---

### 🔸 3. Payload (Data)

This is the **actual data** being sent, such as an IPv4 packet.

- **Minimum size**: 46 bytes  
- **Maximum size**: 1500 bytes  

📌 **Padding** is added if the data is smaller than 46 bytes.

> Example:  
> If your data is 36 bytes, 10 bytes of padding are added to make 46 bytes total.

---

### 🔸 4. Trailer – FCS (Frame Check Sequence)

| Field | Size     | Purpose                                                      |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| FCS   | 4 bytes  | Detects transmission errors using **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)** |

- Verifies the integrity of the frame  
- If FCS fails, the frame is **dropped**

---

## 📏 Minimum Ethernet Frame Size = 64 Bytes

To ensure reliable communication, **Ethernet requires a minimum frame size of 64 bytes**.

| Part          | Size           |
|---------------|----------------|
| Header        | 14 bytes       |
| Payload       | 46 bytes (min) |
| Trailer (FCS) | 4 bytes        |

✅ **Total** = 14 + 46 + 4 = **64 bytes**

📌 If payload < 46 bytes → **padding is added** to meet this size

---

## ✅ Key Points to Remember

- The Ethernet frame is the **standard format** for sending data in a LAN  
- The **header** contains MAC addressing and type/length  
- The **payload** is the actual data (can include padding)  
- The **FCS trailer** checks if the frame is valid  
- **Preamble and SFD** come before the frame and help sync devices  
- The **minimum total frame size is 64 bytes**  
- The **maximum payload size is 1500 bytes**

## ✅ Summary Table

| Section          | Size            | Function                                      |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Preamble + SFD   | 8 bytes (total)  | Sync and start frame (not part of main frame) |
| Header           | 14 bytes         | MAC addressing and Type/Length info           |
| Payload          | 46–1500 bytes    | Actual data (may include padding)             |
| Trailer (FCS)    | 4 bytes          | CRC-based error detection                     |
| **Total Frame**  | **≥ 64 bytes**   | With padding if needed                        |
