🖧 1. What is a LAN?
LAN = Local Area Network
It is a network of computers and devices that are connected in one building or a small area.

🏢 Example:
Think of an office building with:

Computers

Printers

Servers

Switches

All connected with cables or Wi-Fi. They form a LAN because:

They are close together (local)

They can share files, printers, and internet

📢 2. What is a Broadcast Domain?
A broadcast means sending a message to everyone on the network.

A broadcast domain is the area in a network where a broadcast message is received by all devices.

📦 Example:
If PC1 says:

“Who has IP address 192.168.1.5?”
...all devices in the same broadcast domain will hear this.

🧱 Important Points:
Switches do NOT stop broadcasts. (They forward them to all ports)

Routers DO stop broadcasts.

Each VLAN is a separate broadcast domain.

🏷️ 3. What is a VLAN?
VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network

It allows you to divide a single physical switch into multiple small virtual networks.

🎓 Simple Example:
In a school, there’s one big switch, and computers for:

Teachers

Students

Admin staff

We can create:

VLAN 10 for Teachers

VLAN 20 for Students

VLAN 30 for Admin

Each group has its own network, even though all are connected to the same switch.

🎯 4. What is the Purpose of VLAN?
Why use VLANs? Let’s make it very simple:

| Benefit        | Simple Explanation                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Security     | People in one VLAN can't access others without permission. |
| ✅ Organization | Keeps departments separate (HR, IT, Sales).                |
| ✅ Control      | Reduces network traffic — only same VLAN hears broadcast.  |
| ✅ Flexibility  | Devices can be anywhere physically but still in same VLAN. |


🛠️ 5. How to Configure VLANs on Cisco Switches (with Commands)
Let’s say we want to create 3 VLANs:

VLAN 10 → HR

VLAN 20 → Sales

VLAN 30 → IT

We will also assign ports:

Port Fa0/1 → VLAN 10

Port Fa0/2 → VLAN 20

Port Fa0/3 → VLAN 30

| 🔢 Step | 💻 Command(s) | 🧠 Description |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **1** | `enable`<br>`configure terminal` | Accesses global configuration mode from user EXEC mode. |
| **2** | `vlan 10`<br>`name HR`<br>`exit`<br><br>`vlan 20`<br>`name Sales`<br>`exit`<br><br>`vlan 30`<br>`name IT`<br>`exit` | Creates VLANs 10, 20, and 30 and assigns readable names for clarity. |
| **3** | `interface fa0/1`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 10`<br>`exit` | Configures Fa0/1 as an access port and assigns it to VLAN 10 (HR). |
| **4** | `interface fa0/2`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 20`<br>`exit` | Configures Fa0/2 as an access port and assigns it to VLAN 20 (Sales). |
| **5** | `interface fa0/3`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 30`<br>`exit` | Configures Fa0/3 as an access port and assigns it to VLAN 30 (IT). |
| **6** | `interface fa0/24`<br>`switchport mode trunk`<br>`switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30`<br>`exit` | Configures Fa0/24 as a **trunk port** to allow inter-switch VLAN traffic. |
| **7** | `show vlan brief` | Displays VLANs and their associated access ports. Useful for verifying configuration. |

### 📋 Sample Output of `show vlan brief`

| VLAN | Name    | Ports    |
|------|---------|----------|
| 10   | HR      | Fa0/1    |
| 20   | Sales   | Fa0/2    |
| 30   | IT      | Fa0/3    |
| 1    | Default | Fa0/4–23 |

✅ **Tip:** Use trunk ports for inter-switch connections to carry multiple VLANs over a single link.

## 🔧 VLAN Configuration Without Trunk Port (One Cable per VLAN – Access Links Only)

---

### 📘 Scenario

Instead of using a trunk port, we’ll use **one physical cable per VLAN**, connecting:

- **Gi0/1** for VLAN 10 (HR)  
- **Gi0/2** for VLAN 20 (Sales)  
- **Gi0/3** for VLAN 30 (IT)

Each interface is in **access mode**, dedicated to a specific VLAN.  
This method is sometimes used instead of **Router-on-a-Stick** when trunking is not required or supported.

---

### 🧠 Use Case

- ✅ Simple configuration  
- ✅ No VLAN tagging required (no 802.1Q or subinterfaces)  
- ✅ Best for small networks or legacy equipment  
- ⚠️ Each VLAN must have its **own physical connection** (more ports used)

### 🛠️ VLAN + Access Port Configuration (Switch Side)

| 🔢 Step | 💻 Command(s) | 🧠 Description |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **1** | `enable`<br>`configure terminal` | Enter global configuration mode. |
| **2** | `vlan 10`<br>`name HR`<br>`exit`<br><br>`vlan 20`<br>`name Sales`<br>`exit`<br><br>`vlan 30`<br>`name IT`<br>`exit` | Create VLANs and assign names. |
| **3** | `interface gigabitEthernet 0/1`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 10`<br>`exit` | Assign Gi0/1 to VLAN 10 (HR). |
| **4** | `interface gigabitEthernet 0/2`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 20`<br>`exit` | Assign Gi0/2 to VLAN 20 (Sales). |
| **5** | `interface gigabitEthernet 0/3`<br>`switchport mode access`<br>`switchport access vlan 30`<br>`exit` | Assign Gi0/3 to VLAN 30 (IT). |

### ✅ Router Interface Setup (One Physical Interface per VLAN)

If connecting to a router without trunking, each VLAN uses a **separate physical interface**:

```bash
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal

! VLAN 10 - HR
Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

! VLAN 20 - Sales
Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

! VLAN 30 - IT
Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/2
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

🧾 Summary
✅ No trunk ports used

✅ Each VLAN has its own dedicated cable (interface)

✅ Easy to understand and configure

⚠️ Uses more physical interfaces

⚠️ Not scalable for large networks
