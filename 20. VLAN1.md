üñß 1. What is a LAN?
LAN = Local Area Network
It is a network of computers and devices that are connected in one building or a small area.

üè¢ Example:
Think of an office building with:

Computers

Printers

Servers

Switches

All connected with cables or Wi-Fi. They form a LAN because:

They are close together (local)

They can share files, printers, and internet

üì¢ 2. What is a Broadcast Domain?
A broadcast means sending a message to everyone on the network.

A broadcast domain is the area in a network where a broadcast message is received by all devices.

üì¶ Example:
If PC1 says:

‚ÄúWho has IP address 192.168.1.5?‚Äù
...all devices in the same broadcast domain will hear this.

üß± Important Points:
Switches do NOT stop broadcasts. (They forward them to all ports)

Routers DO stop broadcasts.

Each VLAN is a separate broadcast domain.

üè∑Ô∏è 3. What is a VLAN?
VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network

It allows you to divide a single physical switch into multiple small virtual networks.

üéì Simple Example:
In a school, there‚Äôs one big switch, and computers for:

Teachers

Students

Admin staff

We can create:

VLAN 10 for Teachers

VLAN 20 for Students

VLAN 30 for Admin

Each group has its own network, even though all are connected to the same switch.

üéØ 4. What is the Purpose of VLAN?
Why use VLANs? Let‚Äôs make it very simple:

| Benefit        | Simple Explanation                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Security     | People in one VLAN can't access others without permission. |
| ‚úÖ Organization | Keeps departments separate (HR, IT, Sales).                |
| ‚úÖ Control      | Reduces network traffic ‚Äî only same VLAN hears broadcast.  |
| ‚úÖ Flexibility  | Devices can be anywhere physically but still in same VLAN. |


üõ†Ô∏è 5. How to Configure VLANs on Cisco Switches (with Commands)
Let‚Äôs say we want to create 3 VLANs:

VLAN 10 ‚Üí HR

VLAN 20 ‚Üí Sales

VLAN 30 ‚Üí IT

We will also assign ports:

Port Fa0/1 ‚Üí VLAN 10

Port Fa0/2 ‚Üí VLAN 20

Port Fa0/3 ‚Üí VLAN 30

üîß Step-by-Step Guide:
‚úÖ Step 1: Enter the Switch and Go to Configuration Mode

Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal

Now you're inside global configuration mode.

‚úÖ Step 2: Create VLANs

Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name HR
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 30
Switch(config-vlan)# name IT
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

You just created 3 VLANs with names.

‚úÖ Step 3: Assign VLANs to Ports
Now assign specific ports to the VLANs.

Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if)# exit

Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/2
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if)# exit

Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/3
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 30
Switch(config-if)# exit


Each port is now part of a specific VLAN.

‚úÖ Step 4: Verify VLAN Configuration
Check your VLANs:

Switch# show vlan brief

You will see output like this:

| VLAN | Name    | Ports    |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 10   | HR      | Fa0/1    |
| 20   | Sales   | Fa0/2    |
| 30   | IT      | Fa0/3    |
| 1    | Default | Fa0/4-24 |

‚öôÔ∏è BONUS: How to Connect Two Switches (Trunk Port)
If you want to allow VLANs to pass between two switches:

Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/24
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
Switch(config-if)# exit


This tells the switch to carry all VLANs across that port.
