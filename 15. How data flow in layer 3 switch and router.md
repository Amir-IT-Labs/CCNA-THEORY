🔹 PART 1: What is a Layer 3 Switch?
A Layer 3 switch works like a normal switch (Layer 2) and like a router (Layer 3).

It can:

Forward traffic using MAC addresses (like a switch).

Route traffic using IP addresses (like a router).

It’s mostly used to route between VLANs (Inter-VLAN routing).

🔸 Layer 3 Switch = Switch + Router (in one box)
🔹 PART 2: What is a Router?
A router works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.

It is used to:

Connect different networks (e.g., different subnets or different VLANs).

Forward packets based on IP addresses.

Routers use a routing table to decide where to send data.

🚀 How Data Flows in Layer 3 Devices – Step-by-Step
✅ 1. Packet is Created
A computer (PC1) sends data to another device (e.g., PC2).

If PC2 is in another network, the packet needs to go through a router or Layer 3 switch.

The data is wrapped inside a packet with:

Source and Destination IP addresses

Source and Destination MAC addresses

✅ 2. Checking the IP Address
The Layer 3 device (router or L3 switch) reads the destination IP address.

It compares it to its routing table.

Example:

Destination IP: 192.168.20.10
Router checks routing table:
  - 192.168.20.0/24 → send to interface Gig0/1

✅ 3. Find Next Hop
The router or L3 switch finds the next-hop IP address or exit interface.

If it’s a directly connected network, it sends the packet out that interface.

If it’s a remote network, it sends to the next router.

✅ 4. Frame is Rebuilt (Encapsulation)
The router removes the old frame (old MAC addresses).

It creates a new frame with:

Same IP addresses

New MAC addresses for the next device in path

✅ 5. Forward the Packet
The packet is forwarded out the right interface.

It reaches the next device, either the final destination or another router.

✅ 6. Repeat Until Destination
Each router along the path repeats the same process until the packet reaches the destination network.

🖥️ Layer 3 Switch – Special Case (Inter-VLAN Routing)
Let’s say:

PC1 is in VLAN 10 → 192.168.10.10

PC2 is in VLAN 20 → 192.168.20.20

A Layer 3 switch can do routing between VLANs using SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces).

Each VLAN has an IP interface on the Layer 3 switch.

PC1 sends packet to default gateway (SVI of VLAN 10).

Layer 3 switch routes it to SVI of VLAN 20.

Then forwards it to PC2.

🧰 Routing Table Basics

| Destination Network | Subnet Mask   | Next Hop / Interface |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 192.168.10.0        | 255.255.255.0 | Gig0/1               |
| 192.168.20.0        | 255.255.255.0 | Gig0/2               |


Routers and Layer 3 switches use this table to decide where to send the data

📌 Differences Between Layer 2 Switch, Layer 3 Switch, and Router

| Feature             | Layer 2 Switch  | Layer 3 Switch        | Router                       |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Layer               | Layer 2         | Layer 2 + Layer 3     | Layer 3                      |
| Uses MAC addresses? | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                         |
| Uses IP addresses?  | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                        |
| Can route traffic?  | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes (between VLANs) | ✅ Yes (between networks)     |
| Performance         | Fast (hardware) | Faster than router    | Slower than L3 switch        |
| Used for            | LAN switching   | VLAN routing in LANs  | WAN, Internet, large routing |


📖 Example Scenario

PC1 (192.168.1.10) → Router → PC2 (192.168.2.10)

PC1 sends packet to PC2:
1. Router checks the IP.
2. Finds the route to 192.168.2.0.
3. Sends packet out the correct port.
4. Packet arrives at PC2.
