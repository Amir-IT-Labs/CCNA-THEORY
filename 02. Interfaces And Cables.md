📚 CCNA Notes – Ethernet & Types of Cables (Simple and Clear)
🔹 What is Ethernet?
Ethernet is a technology used to connect computers and other devices in a local area network (LAN).

It’s a group of standards and rules that tell how devices communicate and how data is transferred.

Ethernet sends data in the form of bits (like kilobits, megabits, gigabits, terabits).

🔌 Copper Cables in Ethernet
The most common cable type used in Ethernet is:

✅ UTP – Unshielded Twisted Pair
A cable made up of 4 pairs (8 wires total) of copper wires.

The wires are twisted to reduce interference.

Used for full-duplex communication, which means sending and receiving data at the same time.

Each end of the cable has an RJ45 connector that plugs into a network port (also called RJ45 port).

📥 How Data is Sent and Received
For 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet:

Devices send data on pin 1 and pin 2

Devices receive data on pin 3 and pin 6

Devices like PCs and routers use this same rule.

🧵 Types of Ethernet Cables
1️⃣ Straight-Through Cable
Used to connect different types of devices, like:

PC to Switch

Router to Switch

The wires inside match from one end to the other:

Pin 1 connects to Pin 1, Pin 2 to Pin 2, and so on.

2️⃣ Crossover Cable
Used to connect same-type devices, like:

Router to Router

Switch to Switch

The wire connection is crossed:

Pin 1 connects to Pin 3

Pin 2 connects to Pin 6

📌 Why crossover is needed:
If both devices send on pins 1 and 2, and receive on 3 and 6, they won’t understand each other. So crossover cables switch the send and receive pins to match correctly.

⚙️ Auto-MDI-X (Modern Feature)
Many modern switches and routers can automatically adjust the pin roles.

So even if you use a straight-through cable, it can act like a crossover cable if needed.

This makes cabling easier in modern networks.

⚡ Ethernet Speeds and Cable Use

| Speed    | Wires Used            | Notes                               |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 10 Mbps  | 2 pairs (1,2 and 3,6) | Basic speed                         |
| 100 Mbps | 2 pairs (1,2 and 3,6) | Fast Ethernet                       |
| 1 Gbps+  | All 4 pairs (1–8)     | Used for Gigabit and Terabit speeds |

📏 Maximum Distance for UTP
UTP cables can be used for up to 100 meters (328 feet).

Good for small office or LAN environments.

Not suitable for long-distance communication.

🔐 Security in Copper Cables
Copper cables can leak a small signal that someone could possibly listen to (signal sniffing).

Also, they are affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other electrical devices.

🌐 Fiber Optic Cables (Advanced Ethernet)
To solve the distance and EMI problems, fiber optic cables are used.

🔗 SFP Ports
Found on switches and routers.

Used to connect fiber optic cables.

SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable) ports accept special fiber modules.

💡 How Fiber Optic Works
Sends light signals instead of electrical signals.

Light travels through a glass or plastic fiber to carry data.

🧱 Structure of Fiber Optic Cable
Core – The center glass where light travels

Cladding – Reflects light back into the core

Buffer – Protects the cladding

Jacket – The outer layer for physical safety

🔍 Types of Fiber Optic Cable

| Type                        | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Mode Fiber (SMF) | Small core, long-distance (10+ km), uses lasers, more expensive |
| Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)  | Bigger core, shorter distance (up to 2 km), uses LEDs, cheaper  |

📏 Fiber vs. Copper (Distance)

| Cable Type   | Max Distance         |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| UTP (Copper) | 100 meters           |
| MMF (Fiber)  | \~150 meters to 2 km |
| SMF (Fiber)  | 10+ kilometers       |


🔐 Security in Fiber Cables
Fiber cables don’t leak data signals – more secure.

Immune to EMI.

Ideal for high-speed and secure communication over long distances.

| Connection Type            | Recommended Cable         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| PC to Switch               | Straight-through          |
| Router to Switch           | Straight-through          |
| Router to Router           | Crossover (or Auto-MDI-X) |
| Switch to Switch           | Crossover (or Auto-MDI-X) |
