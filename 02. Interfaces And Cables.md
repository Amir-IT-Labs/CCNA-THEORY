# 📚 CCNA Notes – Ethernet & Types of Cables (Simple and Clear)

---

## 🔹 What is Ethernet?

**Ethernet** is a technology used to connect computers and other devices in a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

- It’s a set of **standards and rules** that define how devices communicate and transfer data.
- Ethernet transmits data as bits (kilobits, megabits, gigabits, terabits).

## 🔌 Copper Cables in Ethernet

The most common cable type in Ethernet:

### ✅ UTP – Unshielded Twisted Pair

- Contains **4 pairs (8 wires)** of copper wires
- Wires are **twisted** to reduce interference (EMI)
- Supports **full-duplex communication** (send and receive at the same time)
- Uses **RJ45 connectors** at both ends (connect to network ports)

## 📥 How Data is Sent and Received

For **10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet**:

| Function     | Pins Used |
|--------------|-----------|
| Send Data    | 1, 2      |
| Receive Data | 3, 6      |

Devices like **PCs and routers** follow this same pin convention.

## 🧵 Types of Ethernet Cables

### 1️⃣ Straight-Through Cable

Used to connect **different types** of devices:

- PC ↔ Switch  
- Router ↔ Switch  

> 🟢 Pin 1 ↔ Pin 1, Pin 2 ↔ Pin 2, etc.

---

### 2️⃣ Crossover Cable

Used to connect **same-type** devices:

- Router ↔ Router  
- Switch ↔ Switch  

> 🔁 Pin 1 ↔ Pin 3, Pin 2 ↔ Pin 6

📌 **Why crossover?**  
Both devices send on pins 1 & 2 and receive on 3 & 6 — a crossover matches them correctly.

---

### ⚙️ Auto-MDI-X (Modern Feature)

- Most modern routers/switches support **Auto-MDI-X**
- It automatically adjusts pin roles
- You can use **straight-through cables even for crossover connections**

## ⚡ Ethernet Speeds and Wire Usage

| Speed     | Pairs Used        | Notes                       |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 10 Mbps   | 2 pairs (1,2 & 3,6)| Basic Ethernet              |
| 100 Mbps  | 2 pairs (1,2 & 3,6)| Fast Ethernet               |
| 1 Gbps+   | All 4 pairs (1–8)  | Gigabit/Terabit Ethernet    |

## 📏 Maximum Distance for UTP

- UTP cables can be used up to **100 meters (328 feet)**
- Suitable for **small LANs and offices**
- ❌ Not ideal for long-distance communication

---

## 🔐 Security in Copper Cables

- Copper cables can **leak small electrical signals** — risk of **signal sniffing**
- Affected by **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)** from other electrical devices

---

## 🌐 Fiber Optic Cables (Advanced Ethernet)

To overcome EMI and distance issues, networks use **fiber optic cables**.

---

### 🔗 SFP Ports

- Found on switches and routers  
- Accept **fiber optic modules** (SFP = Small Form-factor Pluggable)

---

### 💡 How Fiber Optic Works

- Sends **light signals** instead of electrical signals  
- Light travels through **glass or plastic fiber** to carry data

---

### 🧱 Structure of Fiber Optic Cable

| Layer     | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Core      | Glass center where light travels  |
| Cladding  | Reflects light back into the core |
| Buffer    | Protects the cladding             |
| Jacket    | Outer layer for safety            |

### 🔍 Types of Fiber Optic Cable

| Type               | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)** | Small core, **long-distance** (10+ km), uses lasers, more expensive |
| **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)**  | Bigger core, **shorter distance** (up to 2 km), uses LEDs, cheaper |

## 📏 Fiber vs. Copper (Distance Comparison)

| Cable Type     | Max Distance          |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| UTP (Copper)   | 100 meters            |
| MMF (Fiber)    | ~150 meters to 2 km   |
| SMF (Fiber)    | 10+ kilometers        |

---

## 🔐 Security in Fiber Cables

- ✅ Fiber does **not leak data signals** — more secure  
- ✅ Immune to **EMI**  
- ✅ Ideal for **high-speed and secure long-distance** communication

## 🔄 Summary: When to Use Each Cable

| Connection Type        | Recommended Cable        |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| PC to Switch           | Straight-through         |
| Router to Switch       | Straight-through         |
| Router to Router       | Crossover (or Auto-MDI-X)|
| Switch to Switch       | Crossover (or Auto-MDI-X)|
| Long distance / High speed | Fiber Optic Cable     |
