## 🔹 What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address) is a unique physical address that is built into a network device (like a computer, switch, router, or mobile phone) when it's manufactured.

It is used to identify a device on a local network (LAN).  
🧠 Think of it like a fingerprint for your network device — no two are the same (unless manually changed).

### 📐 Size of a MAC Address

- A MAC address is **6 bytes (48 bits)** in size  
- Written as **12 hexadecimal characters**

**Example Format:**  
`00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

---

### 💡 Hexadecimal System Used

MAC addresses use hexadecimal digits:



0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F


Each hex digit = 4 bits  
Total MAC address = 48 bits

### 🔧 Types of MAC Addresses

#### ✅ Burned-In Address (BIA)
- The default, permanent MAC address assigned by the manufacturer
- Programmed into the NIC (Network Interface Card)
- Also called the **factory MAC address**

#### ⚙️ Locally Administered Address (LAA)
- Manually configured by user/admin
- Overrides the BIA
- Not globally unique — often used for virtualization or testing

### 🧬 Structure of a MAC Address

A MAC address has **two parts**:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **First 3 bytes (24 bits)** | OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) – identifies the manufacturer |
| **Last 3 bytes (24 bits)**  | Device Identifier – uniquely identifies the specific device |

**Example:**  
If MAC = `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`  
- `00:1A:2B` = Vendor OUI  
- `3C:4D:5E` = Device ID

### 🧠 Where Does the MAC Address Work?

- Used at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model  
- Works for communication **within a local network (LAN)**

**Examples:**
- PC ↔ Switch
- PC ↔ PC (in same LAN)

❌ Not used for communication **between** networks — IP addresses handle that (Layer 3).

### 📡 How MAC Addresses Help in Communication

- Devices send data to the **MAC address** of the destination device
- Switches use MAC tables to **forward frames** to the correct port

### 📌 Key Points to Remember

- **MAC** = Media Access Control  
- **Size:** 48 bits (6 bytes)  
- **Format:** Hexadecimal (separated by `:` or `-`)  
  - `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E` or `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`  
- Every device has a **unique MAC** (unless manually changed)  
- Used for **LAN communication only**  
- Cannot route across networks like IP addresses can

### ✅ Summary

| Feature       | Description                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| MAC Address   | Physical, hardware-based address       |
| Size          | 6 bytes (48 bits)                      |
| Format        | Hexadecimal (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)  |
| OSI Layer     | Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)  |
| Used For      | Device identification in LAN           |
