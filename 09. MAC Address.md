🔹 What is a MAC Address?
A MAC Address (Media Access Control Address) is a unique physical address that is built into a network device (like a computer, switch, router, or mobile phone) when it's manufactured.

It is used to identify a device on a local network (LAN).

Think of it like a fingerprint for your network device — no two are the same (unless manually changed).

📐 Size of a MAC Address:
A MAC address is 6 bytes (48 bits) in size.

It is usually written as 12 hexadecimal characters.

🧾 Example Format:
00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

💡 Hexadecimal System Used:
A MAC address is made up of hexadecimal numbers, which are:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

Each hex digit represents 4 bits, and the entire MAC address represents 48 bits.

🔧 Types of MAC Addresses:
1. ✅ Burned-In Address (BIA):
This is the default, permanent MAC address assigned to a device by the manufacturer.

It is programmed into the NIC (Network Interface Card).

Also called the factory MAC address.

2. ⚙️ Locally Administered Address (LAA):
This MAC address is manually configured by the user or administrator.

It overrides the default BIA.

Not globally unique — used for testing or virtualization environments.

🧬 Structure of a MAC Address:
Every MAC address is divided into two parts:

🔹 First 3 bytes (24 bits) – OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier):
Identifies the manufacturer or vendor of the device.

Example:

00:1A:2B might belong to Cisco

00:0C:29 might belong to VMware

🔹 Last 3 bytes (24 bits) – Device Identifier:
Uniquely identifies that specific device within the manufacturer’s list.

🧾 Example:
If a MAC address is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

00:1A:2B is the vendor's OUI

3C:4D:5E is the device-specific part

🧠 Where Does the MAC Address Work?
MAC addresses are used at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

They are used for communication inside local networks, like:

PC to switch

Switch to another PC

Devices inside the same LAN

❌ MAC addresses cannot be used to route data between networks. For that, IP addresses (Layer 3) are used.

📡 How MAC Addresses Help in Communication:
When one device sends data to another in a local network, it sends it to the MAC address of the target device.

Switches use MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct destination port.

📌 Key Points to Remember:
MAC stands for Media Access Control

It’s 48 bits long (6 bytes)

It is written in hexadecimal, often separated by colons (:) or hyphens (-)

Example: 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E or 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Every network device has a unique MAC address by default

MAC addresses are used in LAN-level communication, not across the internet
