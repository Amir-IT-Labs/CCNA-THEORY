📍 What is a Layer 2 Switch?
A Layer 2 switch is a device used in networks to connect computers and devices inside the same local area (like inside a home, school, or office).

It works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

It uses MAC addresses (not IP addresses) to send data from one device to another.

A switch keeps a list (called a MAC address table) to remember which devices are connected to which ports.

🔄 How Does a Switch Send Data? Step-by-Step
✅ 1. A Frame Arrives
A frame is like a package of data. It includes:

Sender's MAC address

Receiver's MAC address

Example:
📦 PC1 sends a frame to PC2 → This frame reaches the switch.

📘 2. The Switch Learns the Sender
The switch looks at the source MAC address (sender).

It remembers which port the sender is connected to by saving it in the MAC address table.

Example:
If PC1 (MAC: A1-A1-A1...) is connected to port F0/1, the switch saves:

MAC Address: A1-A1-A1... → Port: F0/1

This is called MAC learning.

🧭 3. The Switch Checks the Receiver
Now the switch checks the destination MAC address (who the data is for).

Two situations:

✅ If the switch knows the receiver's MAC:
It sends the frame only to that port.

This is called Unicast forwarding.

❌ If the switch does NOT know the receiver's MAC:
It sends (or floods) the frame to all ports, except the sender's port.

This way, the receiver will still get it.

After the receiver replies, the switch learns where it is.

🚚 4. The Frame is Sent
The switch sends the frame:

To the correct device, if it knows the port.

To everyone, if it doesn’t yet know.

⏳ 5. MAC Table Timeout
The switch keeps MAC addresses in the table for a short time (usually 5 minutes).

If a device doesn’t send anything during that time, its MAC address is removed from the table.

This helps keep the table clean and updated.

📌 Summary of What the Switch Does
Action	Meaning
Learning	Remembers which MAC address is on which port.
Forwarding	Sends frames to the correct device if it knows where it is.
Flooding	Sends to all devices when it doesn’t know where to send.
Filtering	Does not send frames back to the port they came from.
Aging	Removes MAC entries after a few minutes of no activity.

💡 Extra Concepts
🔸 Broadcast Domain vs Collision Domain
A switch port = one collision domain → less chance of data collision.

All ports in the same VLAN = one broadcast domain → all devices can receive broadcast messages.

📐 Example with 3 PCs and a Switch

PC1 --------> (Switch) <-------- PC2
               |
              PC3

PC1 sends data to PC2.

Switch checks the sender (PC1) and learns its MAC address.

Switch looks for PC2’s MAC:

If known → sends directly to PC2.

If unknown → sends to PC2 and PC3 (flood).

When PC2 replies, the switch learns its MAC and saves it.
