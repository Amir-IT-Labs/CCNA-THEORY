---

## Purpose of Root Guard

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) prevents loops by electing a **root bridge** and ensuring that every other switch has only one valid path to reach it.

However, you should **not randomly** select the root bridge. Some important factors to consider include:

- Optimal traffic flow  
- Minimizing latency  
- Reducing congestion  
- Ensuring stability and reliability  

---

## Controlling the Root Bridge

Within your LAN, you can easily control the root bridge by **setting its priority to 0**.

But there are scenarios where your LAN connects to **external switches** beyond your direct control, such as:

- A **service provider** offering Metro Ethernet service  
- Connectivity between sites within a **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**  

Even if your root bridge priority is 0, its role can still be taken by another switch with a **lower MAC address**.

---

## What is Root Guard?

**Root Guard** can be configured to protect your STP topology by **preventing your switches from accepting superior BPDUs** from switches outside your control.

> **Superior BPDU**: A BPDU that claims a better root bridge ID (based on lower priority or lower MAC address).

To **keep the root bridge inside your LAN**, enable Root Guard on **ports that connect to external switches**.

---

## Root Guard Configuration

To enable Root Guard on a port:
```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree guard root
```

- There is **no global command** to enable Root Guard by default.

If a Root Guard-enabled port receives a **superior BPDU**, it will enter the **broken (root-inconsistent)** state.

### Behavior of Root-Inconsistent Port:
- The port is **effectively disabled**.
- It will **not forward data frames**.
- It will **discard** any received frames.

---

## Recovery

To re-enable a port disabled by Root Guard:

1. Fix the issue that caused the port to enter the root-inconsistent state.
2. The port must **stop receiving superior BPDUs**.

You can ask the external administrator (e.g., service provider) to **increase the bridge priority** on their switch.

Once the superior BPDUs stop arriving, the port will **automatically re-enable itself**.

> The default **Max Age** for BPDUs is **20 seconds**. After this time, the port will recover if no more superior BPDUs are received.
