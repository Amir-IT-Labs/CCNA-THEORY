# 🧠 STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) Port States and Timers – Explained in Simple Words

---

## 🔄 STP Port Behavior

- **Root/Designated Ports**: Stay stable in the **Forwarding** state.
- **Non-Designated Ports**: Stay stable in the **Blocking** state.
- **Listening** and **Learning** are **transitional** states. Ports pass through these states when:
  - A port is first activated.
  - A blocking port transitions to join the network.
- **Disabled State**: When a port is **administratively shut down** by the network administrator.

---

## 🔒 Blocking State

1. Non-designated ports stay in the **blocking** state.
2. These ports are **effectively disabled** to prevent loops.
3. They **do not send or receive** normal traffic.
4. They **do receive** STP BPDUs.
5. But they **do not forward** STP BPDUs.
6. They **do not learn** MAC addresses.

---

## 👂 Listening State

1. After blocking, **designated or root** ports move into the **listening** state.
2. Only designated or root ports do this; non-designated ports stay in blocking.
3. **Duration**: 15 seconds (controlled by **Forward Delay** timer).
4. Ports **only receive/forward** STP BPDUs in this state.
5. No normal data traffic is sent or received.
6. Ports **do not learn** MAC addresses in this state.

## 📘 Learning State

1. After listening, designated/root ports move to the **learning** state.
2. **Duration**: 15 seconds (same Forward Delay timer).
3. Ports **only send/receive** STP BPDUs.
4. Normal data traffic is **not allowed** yet.
5. Ports **learn MAC addresses** from incoming traffic.

---

## 🚀 Forwarding State

1. **Root and designated** ports enter the **forwarding** state.
2. These ports work **normally**.
3. They **send and receive** STP BPDUs.
4. They **send and receive** normal data traffic.
5. They **learn MAC addresses**.

## ⏱️ STP Timers

### 🟡 Hello Timer
- Tells how often the **Root Bridge** sends Hello BPDUs.
- **Default**: Every 2 seconds.

### 🕓 Forward Delay
- Time a port spends in **Listening** and **Learning** states.
- **Default**: 15 seconds each (total 30 seconds).

### ⏳ Max Age
- How long a port waits after **no Hello BPDUs** are received.
- **Default**: 20 seconds (10 × Hello interval).

## 🔁 BPDU Logic and Transition

- If a BPDU is received **before Max Age** ends:
  - The timer resets to 20 seconds.
  - No changes are made.
- If **no BPDU is received**, the switch:
  - Recalculates the STP topology.
  - Reevaluates the Root Bridge and port roles.

If a non-designated port is selected to become a **Root or Designated** port:

1. It moves from **Blocking → Listening (15 sec)**  
2. Then **Listening → Learning (15 sec)**  
3. Then **Learning → Forwarding**

⏱️ **Total transition time** = **50 seconds**

---

## ⚠️ Important Transition Rules

- A **Forwarding** port can go **directly to Blocking** (safe).
- A **Blocking** port **cannot go directly to Forwarding**.
  - It must pass through **Listening and Learning** states.

This timing and process prevent loops in the Layer 2 network caused by ports moving to forwarding too quickly.
