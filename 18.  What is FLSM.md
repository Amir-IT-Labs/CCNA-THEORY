🧾 What is FLSM?
FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Masking) means all subnets have the same subnet mask, and each subnet has the same number of IP addresses.

📌 Key Concepts Before Starting:
🔹 IP Address:
An IPv4 address is made up of 32 bits, divided into 4 octets (e.g. 192.168.1.0).

🔹 Subnet Mask:
It defines how many bits are used for network and how many for hosts.
Example:

/24 = 255.255.255.0 → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts

📘 When is FLSM used?
In older networks

When you want equal-sized networks

When IP address waste is not a concern

Simpler to calculate than VLSM

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of FLSM like slicing a pizza into equal-sized pieces, regardless of how hungry each person is.

🧮 FLSM Subnetting Step-by-Step:
Let’s go through an example:

🎯 Scenario:
You are given a Class C IP: 192.168.10.0/24
You need 4 equal-sized subnets

✅ Step 1: Convert requirements to binary logic
You want 4 subnets.
Use the formula:

2^n ≥ number of subnets  
2^2 = 4 ⇒ n = 2

So, we borrow 2 bits from the host portion.

✅ Step 2: New Subnet Mask
Original mask: /24
After borrowing 2 bits: 24 + 2 = /26
New subnet mask: 255.255.255.192

Why?

| Bits                                                                  | Value |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| 2                                                                          | 192   |


Because in binary: `11000000 = 192` 




✅ Step 3: Subnet Calculation
With /26 (6 bits for host):

2^6 = 64 addresses per subnet  
But 2 are reserved (network + broadcast):  
64 - 2 = 62 usable IPs per subnet

✅ Step 4: List All Subnets

| Subnet # | Network Address | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast Address |
| -------- | ---------------       | ---------- | --------- | -----------------       |
| 1        | 192.168.10.0       | .1            | .62         | 192.168.10.63     |
| 2        | 192.168.10.64    | .65          | .126      | 192.168.10.127    |
| 3        | 192.168.10.128  | .129       | .190      | 192.168.10.191    |
| 4        | 192.168.10.192  | .193       | .254      | 192.168.10.255    |

| Broadcast Address | Last IP in subnet (used to talk to all hosts in that subnet)                             |
| Usable Hosts             | IPs that can be assigned to devices (between network and broadcast IPs) |


✅ Advantages of FLSM
Easy to calculate and manage

Consistent subnet sizes

Ideal for predictable networks

❌ Disadvantages of FLSM
Wastes IP addresses if subnets don't need equal hosts

Less flexible than VLSM

🧠 Quick Practice:
You are given 10.0.0.0/8 and need 8 equal subnets.
What will be:

The new subnet mask?

Number of hosts per subnet?
