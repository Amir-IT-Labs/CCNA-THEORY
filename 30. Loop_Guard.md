## What Is a Unidirectional Link?

A **unidirectional link** is a network connection where data can flow in **only one direction**.  
Example: SW1 can send frames to SW2, but SW2 cannot send frames back to SW1.

These links are typically caused by **Layer 1 (physical)** issues, such as:

1. Damaged cables  
2. Faulty connectors or transceivers (e.g., SFP modules)  

Unidirectional links are more **common with fiber-optic cables** than copper UTP because:

- Fiber optic connections use **two separate fibers**—one for each direction.
- If one fiber is damaged, traffic may still flow in one direction, leading to a unidirectional link.
- Fiber is more **vulnerable to physical damage** compared to UTP cables.

For a fiber-optic interface to remain **up/up**, both fibers must be connected and functional.  
If one fails but the devices **don't detect the issue**, a unidirectional link can form.

## Example Scenario (3-Switch Network)

- BPDUs originate from the **root bridge** and are forwarded out of **designated ports**.
- SW3's G0/1 port is in **blocking** state because it receives **superior BPDUs** from SW2 (e.g., SW2 has a better root cost or bridge ID).

If the link between SW2 and SW3 becomes **unidirectional** and SW3 **stops receiving BPDUs**, then:

- SW3 G0/1 **transitions to a designated port** and starts forwarding BPDUs.
- Because SW3’s BPDUs are **inferior**, SW2 **ignores** them.
- Now, both SW2 G0/1 and SW3 G0/1 are designated ports in **forwarding** state → **Loop is created!**

---

## How Loop Guard Prevents This

When a **Loop Guard-enabled** port's **Max Age timer** counts down to 0 (i.e., no BPDUs received):

- It does **not** transition to the forwarding state.
- It enters the **broken (loop-inconsistent)** state instead.
- This state **blocks the port** to prevent loops.

> ⚠️ The port remains **up/up**, but STP blocks it.

If the port **starts receiving BPDUs again**, it is **automatically re-enabled**.

## Configuring Loop Guard

**Per-Port Configuration:**
```bash
SW3(config-if)# spanning-tree guard loop
```

**Global Configuration (Default on All Ports):**
```bash
SW3(config)# spanning-tree loopguard default
```

To disable Loop Guard on a specific port:
```bash
SW3(config-if)# spanning-tree guard none
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Enable Loop Guard** on **root ports** and **non-designated ports** (ports that should be receiving BPDUs).
- Do **not** enable Loop Guard on **designated ports** (which send BPDUs).

---

## Compatibility Note

**Loop Guard and Root Guard are mutually exclusive.**  
They **cannot** be enabled on the same port at the same time.

- **Root Guard**: Prevents **designated ports** from becoming **root ports**.
- **Loop Guard**: Prevents **non-designated/root ports** from becoming **designated ports**.

### Configuration Rule

- If Loop Guard is configured on a port and you then configure Root Guard (or vice versa), the previous setting is **overridden**.
- If Loop Guard is enabled globally and you configure Root Guard on a port, **Loop Guard is disabled on that port**.

> The **more specific configuration** (interface level vs global) always takes effect.
