# Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and STP Variants

## Spanning Tree Versions

### 1. Industry Standard (IEEE)

#### Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1D)
- The original STP.
- All VLANs share one STP instance.
- Therefore, it cannot perform load balancing.

#### Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1W)
- Much faster at converging/adapting to network changes compared to 802.1D.
- All VLANs share one STP instance.
- Therefore, it cannot perform load balancing.

#### Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1S)
- Uses modified RSTP mechanics.
- Can group multiple VLANs into different instances.
  - For example: VLAN 1-5 in Instance 1, VLAN 6-10 in Instance 2.
- Enables load balancing across instances.

### 2. Cisco Versions

#### Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+)
- Cisco enhancement to 802.1D.
- Each VLAN has its own STP instance.
- Can load balance by blocking different ports in each VLAN.

#### Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (Rapid PVST+)
- Cisco enhancement to 802.1W.
- Each VLAN has its own STP instance.
- Can load balance by blocking different ports in each VLAN.

> **Note:** RSTP is not a timer-based spanning tree algorithm like 802.1D. It improves over the 30+ seconds that 802.1D takes to move a link to forwarding. The heart of the protocol is a new bridge-to-bridge handshake mechanism, which allows ports to move directly to forwarding.

## Similarities Between STP and RSTP
- Both block specific ports to prevent Layer 2 loops.
- RSTP elects the root bridge using the same rules as STP.
- RSTP elects the root port using the same rules as STP.
- RSTP elects the designated port using the same rules as STP.

## STP vs RSTP Cost Table

| Speed     | STP Cost | RSTP Cost |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 10 Mbps   | 100      | 2,000,000 |
| 100 Mbps  | 19       | 200,000   |
| 1 Gbps    | 4        | 20,000    |
| 10 Gbps   | 2        | 2,000     |
| 100 Gbps  | 0        | 200       |
| 1 Tbps    | 0        | 20        |
| 10 Tbps   | 0        | 2         |

## Rapid Spanning Tree Port Roles

### Root Port
- Remains unchanged in RSTP.
- The port closest to the root bridge.
- Root bridge does **not** have a root port.

### Designated Port
- Remains unchanged.
- The port on a segment (collision domain) that sends the best BPDU.
- Only one designated port per segment.

### Alternate Port
- A discarding port that receives a superior BPDU from another switch.
- Functions as a backup to the root port.
- If the root port fails, this port moves immediately to forwarding.

> **Note:** This behavior is similar to the classic STP optional feature called **UplinkFast**. It is built into RSTP, so there is no need to configure UplinkFast when using RSTP or Rapid PVST+.

### Backup Port
- A discarding port that receives a superior BPDU from another **interface on the same switch**.
- Happens only when two interfaces are connected to the same collision domain (e.g., via a hub).
- Rare in modern networks due to the absence of hubs.
- Functions as a backup for a designated port.
- The interface with the **lowest port ID** becomes the designated port; the other becomes the backup port.

## Built-in Features in RSTP

### UplinkFast & BackboneFast
- Both were optional in classic STP.
- **UplinkFast:** Speeds up convergence when a root port fails.
- **BackboneFast:** Allows a switch to expire max age timers and forward superior BPDUs faster.
- **In RSTP:** These features are **built-in** and enabled by default. No configuration required.

---

## RSTP Compatibility
- RSTP is compatible with classic STP.
- When a Rapid STP-enabled switch connects to a classic STP-enabled switch, it will operate in classic mode on that interface.
- Uses classic STP timers and port states (blocking, listening, learning, forwarding).

> **Note:**
> - In classic STP, only the root bridge originates BPDUs.
> - In RSTP, **all switches** originate and send their own BPDUs from designated ports.

---

## BPDU Handling
- All switches running RSTP send their own BPDUs every hello time (2 seconds).
- RSTP switches age BPDU information much faster.
  - Classic STP: Waits 10 hello intervals (20 seconds).
  - RSTP: Considers a neighbor lost after **3 missed BPDUs** (6 seconds), and flushes MAC addresses learned on that interface.

## RSTP Link Types

### Edge
- Port connected to an end host.
- Moves directly to forwarding without negotiation.
- Similar to STP PortFast.

### Point-to-Point
- Direct full-duplex connection between switches.
- Automatically detected; no configuration needed.

### Shared
- Connection to a hub (half-duplex).
- Rare in modern networks.
- Automatically detected.
