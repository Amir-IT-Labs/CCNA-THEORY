## ⚡ PortFast

### 🔧 Commands:
```
interface g0/1
spanning-tree portfast
```

To enable PortFast globally:
```
spanning-tree portfast default
```

### 📘 Explanation:
- PortFast can be enabled on ports connected to **end hosts**.
- Normally, a designated port transitions through **Listening (15s)** and **Learning (15s)** before reaching **Forwarding**, taking **30 seconds** total.
- This delay exists to **prevent loops**.
- Ports connected to **other switches** can cause loops, but ports connected to **end hosts** do not.
- PortFast allows the port to skip Listening and Learning states and **immediately enter the Forwarding state**.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Only use PortFast on ports connected to end devices (like PCs, printers).  
> Enabling it on switch-to-switch links can cause **Layer 2 loops**.

## 🛡️ BPDU Guard

### 🔧 Commands:
```
interface g0/1
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

To enable BPDU Guard globally on all PortFast-enabled ports:
```
spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
```

### 📘 Explanation:
- BPDU Guard shuts down a port **immediately** if it receives a BPDU.
- This is a **safety feature** to prevent loops on ports that should only connect to end hosts.
- Works best with **PortFast** to secure edge ports.

## 👑 Root Guard

### 📘 Explanation:
- If Root Guard is enabled on a port and that port receives a **BPDU with a lower bridge ID** (suggesting a new Root Bridge), the port is **disabled**.
- This **prevents another switch from becoming the Root Bridge** on a port where you don’t want that to happen.

---

## 🔄 Loop Guard

### 📘 Explanation:
- Normally, if a port **stops receiving BPDUs**, it may mistakenly assume it's safe to start forwarding traffic.
- With Loop Guard enabled, if a port stops receiving BPDUs, it is **moved to a blocking state** instead of forwarding.
- This prevents **unintended loops** caused by unidirectional link failures.

## 🏆 Configuring Root Bridge Priority

To configure a switch as **Primary Root Bridge**:
```
spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
```

- This command sets STP **priority** to **24576**.
- If another switch already has a lower priority, the current switch will set its priority to **4096 less** than the other switch.

To configure a **Secondary Root Bridge**:
```
spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary
```

- This sets the priority to **28672**.

> This ensures predictable Root Bridge election in enterprise environments.
