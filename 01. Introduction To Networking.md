# 🌐 Networking Introduction – Detailed Notes

---

## 🔍 What is Networking?

Networking can be described as the combination of **connectivity and communication** between devices.  
It enables multiple devices to share **data** and **resources** with each other.

> **Definition:**  
> A computer network is a digital telecommunications system that allows devices known as **nodes** to share information and resources.

---

## 🧩 What are Nodes?

**Nodes** are individual devices that participate in a network.

### 📌 Examples of nodes:
- Router  
- Switch  
- Firewall  
- Server  
- Client  

---

## 🖥️ End Devices / End Hosts / Endpoints

These are devices used by users to **interact with the network**.

### ✅ Examples:
- Laptop  
- Desktop PC  
- Smartphone  
- MacBook  
- Tablet  

📘 **Note:** If two end devices are connected (wired or wireless) and can share data, they form a **network** — even if it's just two devices.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Clients and Servers

Networking is based on the **Client-Server model**, where:

- A **Client** requests data or services.  
- A **Server** provides data or services.

---

### ➤ What is a Client?

A **client** is a device that **initiates a request** to access a service or resource.  
Clients depend on servers to fulfill their requests.

---

### ➤ What is a Server?

A **server** is a device that **provides services, data, or resources** to one or more clients.  
Servers are often specialized to perform tasks like:
- Web hosting  
- File sharing  
- Database access  

---

## 🧠 Examples to Understand Client and Server Roles

### ✅ Example 1: PC to PC
- PC1 sends a request for data to PC2  
- **PC1 = Client**, **PC2 = Server** (in this situation)

> 🔄 **Note:** Roles can reverse depending on who is requesting or providing.

---

### ✅ Example 2: Mobile + YouTube
- A user watches a video on YouTube from a smartphone  
- The mobile phone sends a request to YouTube servers  
- YouTube server sends back the requested video

> **Mobile = Client**, **YouTube Server = Server**

---

### ✅ Example 3: Mobile to Mobile
- Mobile1 sends a request for a picture from Mobile2  
- **Mobile1 = Client**, **Mobile2 = Server**

> 🔁 A device can act as **client** in one situation and **server** in another.

## 🧮 Network Devices Overview

---

### 🔌 Switch

A **switch** is a network device used to connect multiple **end devices** within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

#### 🔑 Key Points:
- Allows communication **within the same LAN**  
- Usually has **24 or more ports**  
- Operates mainly at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model  
- Some advanced switches can perform **Layer 3 (routing)** functions  
- ❌ Does not connect to other networks or the internet  

---

### 🌍 Router

A **router** is used to:
- Connect **multiple LANs**
- Connect **LANs to the internet**

#### 🔑 Key Features:
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model  
- Has **fewer interfaces** compared to switches  
- Responsible for **routing packets between networks**  
- Essential for **internet communication**  

---

### 🔥 Firewall

A **firewall** is a **security device** or **software** that:
- Monitors and controls **incoming and outgoing** network traffic  
- Works based on **predefined security rules**

#### 🧱 Placement:
- Can be placed **before or after a router**  
- Can be **inside or outside** the network perimeter  

---

### 🔐 Types of Firewalls:

#### A. Hardware Firewall
- A **physical device** used in large networks  
- Example: Cisco ASA, FortiGate

#### B. Host-Based Firewall
- **Software installed on individual devices** (e.g., PC)  
- Example: Windows Defender Firewall

#### C. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Advanced firewalls with:
- Deep packet inspection  
- Intrusion prevention  
- Application filtering  
- User identity management  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- Networking allows devices to **communicate** and **share resources**  
- **Clients** request services, **servers** provide them  
- Devices like **routers**, **switches**, and **firewalls** play critical roles in how data is transmitted and protected  
- A solid understanding of networking basics is essential for anyone working in IT
