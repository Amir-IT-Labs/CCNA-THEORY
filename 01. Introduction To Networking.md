Networking Introduction – Detailed Notes
1. What is Networking?
Networking can be described as the combination of connectivity and communication between devices. It enables multiple devices to share data and resources with each other.

Definition:
A computer network is a digital telecommunications system that allows devices known as nodes to share information and resources.

2. What are Nodes?
Nodes are individual devices that participate in a network.

Examples of nodes:
Router

Switch

Firewall

Server

Client

Important Note:
Clients are also called end devices, end hosts, or endpoints.

3. End Devices / End Hosts / Endpoints
These are devices used by users to interact with the network.

Examples:
Laptop

Desktop PC

Smartphone

Macbook

Tablet

If two end devices are connected (either wired or wireless) and can share data, then they form a network, even if it's just two devices.

4. Clients and Servers
Networking is based on the Client-Server model, where:

A Client requests data or services.

A Server provides data or services.

➤ What is a Client?
A client is a device that initiates a request to access a service or resource.

Clients depend on servers to fulfill their requests.

➤ What is a Server?
A server is a device that provides services, data, or resources to one or more clients.

Servers are often specialized to provide functions like web hosting, file sharing, database access, etc.

5. Examples to Understand Client and Server Roles
✅ Example 1: PC to PC
PC1 sends a request for data to PC2.

PC1 = Client, PC2 = Server (in this situation).

Note: The roles can reverse depending on who is requesting or providing.

✅ Example 2: Mobile + YouTube
A user watches a video on YouTube from a smartphone.

The mobile phone sends a request to YouTube servers.

YouTube server sends back the requested video.

Mobile = Client, YouTube Server = Server.

✅ Example 3: Mobile to Mobile
Mobile1 sends a request for a picture from Mobile2.

Mobile1 = Client, Mobile2 = Server.

Same device can act as client in one situation and server in another.

6. Switch
A switch is a network device used to connect multiple end devices within a Local Area Network (LAN).

Key Points:
Allows end devices to communicate with each other inside the same LAN.

Usually has 24 or more ports/interfaces.

Works mainly at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

Some Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions too.

Does not provide connectivity between LANs or to the internet.

7. Router
A router is used to:

Connect multiple LANs

Connect LANs to the internet

Key Features:
Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.

Has fewer interfaces than switches.

Responsible for routing packets from one network to another.

Essential for internet communication.

8. Firewall
A firewall is a security device or software that:

Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.

Works based on predefined security rules.

Placement:
Can be installed before or after a router.

Can be inside or outside the network perimeter.

Types of Firewalls:
A. Hardware Firewall:
Physical device.

Used in large enterprise networks.

Example: Cisco ASA, FortiGate.

B. Host-based Firewall:
Software installed on a device (e.g., PC).

Protects the individual host from threats.

Example: Windows Defender Firewall

Next Generation Firewall (NGFW):
Advanced firewalls with:

Deep packet inspection

Intrusion prevention

Application filtering

User identity management

Conclusion
Networking allows devices to communicate and share resources.

Clients request services, servers provide them.

Devices like routers, switches, and firewalls play key roles in how data is transmitted and protected.

A good understanding of networking basics is essential for anyone working with or learning about computer systems.
