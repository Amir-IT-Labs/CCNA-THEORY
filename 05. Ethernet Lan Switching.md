🔹 What is Ethernet LAN Switching?
Ethernet LAN Switching is the process of forwarding data between devices on a local area network (LAN) using switches. This switching happens at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to deliver frames from one device to another.

Switches do not use IP addresses—they rely on the MAC addresses found in Ethernet frames.

🧠 OSI Layers Involved:
✅ Layer 1 – Physical Layer
This is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for the physical transmission of data between network devices.

💡 Main Functions of Layer 1:
Transmits data as electrical signals (for copper cables) or light signals (for fiber cables)

Converts digital bits into signals

Defines:

Voltage levels

Timing

Cable types: UTP, Copper, Fiber

Connectors like RJ45,SDF

Maximum transmission distance

Example: Sending a bit "1" becomes an electric signal on a copper wire.

✅ Layer 2 – Data Link Layer
This layer handles communication between directly connected devices. It wraps data into frames and provides error detection.

💡 Main Functions of Layer 2:
Formats raw data into Ethernet frames

Ensures node-to-node delivery

Adds MAC addresses (source and destination)

Detects (and sometimes corrects) transmission errors

Switches operate at this layer

Example: PC to Switch, Switch to Router, Router to Router—data is framed at Layer 2 and sent via MAC addresses.

📦 Protocol Data Units (PDU):
Each OSI layer has its own data form:

| OSI Layer | PDU Name |
| --------- | -------- |
| Layer 1   | Bits     |
| Layer 2   | Frames   |
| Layer 3   | Packets  |
| Layer 4   | Segments |


In Ethernet Switching, the PDU used is the Frame.

🔍 Ethernet Frame Structure:
Ethernet frames are used to send data in a LAN. They contain headers and trailers for structure and error checking.

🧱 Ethernet Header Fields (5 total):
Preamble (7 bytes)

56 bits of pattern 101010...

Used to synchronize clocks of sender and receiver

Helps receiver get ready to receive the frame

Start Frame Delimiter – SFD (1 byte)

Bit pattern: 10101011

Indicates the end of preamble and start of frame

Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)

MAC address of the receiving device

Tells the switch or device where to send the frame

Like the "To" field in email

Source MAC Address (6 bytes)

MAC address of the sender

Like the "From" field in email

Type / Length (2 bytes)

If value ≤ 1500 → represents length of payload

If value ≥ 1536 → represents EtherType, like IPv4 or IPv6

🧾 Payload (Data Section):
The actual data (e.g., an IPv4 packet)

Size varies, but usually between 46–1500 bytes

🔚 Ethernet Trailer:
FCS – Frame Check Sequence (4 bytes)

Used for error detection

Uses CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

Verifies that data is not corrupted during transmission

🔍 CRC Explanation:
Cyclic: Refers to a cyclic code used for checking

Redundancy: 4 bytes are added at the end, no new data

Check: Confirms if the data frame is valid

🧠 Key Differences Between Layer 2 and Layer 3 Addressing:

| Feature                | Layer 2 (MAC)               | Layer 3 (IP)            |
| -----------------------| ----------------------------| ------------------------|
| Address Type           | Physical Address            | Logical Address         |
| Example                | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E           | 192.168.1.1             |
| Used by                | Switches                    | Routers                 |
| Changes?               | No (hardcoded in NIC)       | Yes (based on network)  |

✅ Summary Points:
Layer 1 deals with signals and transmission

Layer 2 formats and delivers data using MAC addresses

Switches work at Layer 2, and forward frames using MAC tables

Ethernet frame has structured fields for synchronization, addressing, and error checking

FCS helps detect corrupt data using CRC
