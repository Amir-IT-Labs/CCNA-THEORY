üîπ Common Cisco Commands & Their Purpose

|   Command                      |   Explanation                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enable`                       | Enters **privileged EXEC mode**, where important system-level commands are available.                                            |
| `configure terminal`           | Enters **global configuration mode** to make changes to device settings.                                                         |
| `hostname R1` / `hostname SW1` | Changes the **device name** (router or switch), useful for identifying the device.                                               |
| `enable password CCNA`         | Sets a **basic password** to protect privileged EXEC mode. Stored in **plain text**.                                             |
| `enable secret Cisco`          | Sets a **secure password** for privileged mode. Encrypted using **MD5 hashing**.                                                 |
| `service password-encryption`  | Hides all visible passwords using **Type 7 encryption**. Good for basic protection.                                              |
| `exit`                         | Moves **back one step** in the command mode (e.g., from interface config to global config, or global config to privileged mode). |
| `end`                          | Exits configuration mode completely and returns to **privileged EXEC mode** directly.                                            |
| `CTRL + Z`                     | Shortcut for `end` ‚Äî exits configuration mode quickly.                                                                           |


üîê Enable Password vs Enable Secret

| Feature          | `enable password`           | `enable secret`              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Stored as        | Plain text                  | Encrypted (MD5 hash)         |
| Security Level   | Low                         | High                         |
| Command Priority | Lower (ignored if both set) | Higher (always takes effect) |
| Best Practice    | ‚ùå Not Recommended         |   ‚úÖ Always use this          |


üîí If both are configured, the device will always ask for the enable secret password.

üîë Password Encryption ‚Äì What It Does
service password-encryption encrypts all passwords (like console, vty) in the config.

It applies Type 7 encryption, which hides passwords from being read easily.

However, it's not strong and can be reversed.

For strong protection, rely on enable secret which uses one-way MD5 hashing (cannot be decrypted).

üíæ Saving Your Configuration
When you configure a device, the changes go into RAM (running-config). If the device reboots, you lose all changes unless you save them.

‚úÖ Commands to Save Config:

| Command                              | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `copy running-config startup-config` | Saves current config to NVRAM (permanent) |
| `write` / `write memory`             | Does the same thing, shorter command      |

üí° Saved configuration in startup-config loads automatically after a reboot.

üîç Checking Configuration

| Command               | What It Shows                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `show running-config` | Displays current active config in RAM |
| `show startup-config` | Displays saved config in NVRAM        |


üß† Quick Recap of Navigation Commands

| Command    | What It Does                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exit`     | Goes **back one level** in the CLI hierarchy              |
| `end`      | Exits **all config modes** and returns to privileged mode |
| `CTRL + Z` | Shortcut for `end`, instantly exits configuration mode    |


‚úÖ Important Tips to Remember
Use enable secret for secure access, not just enable password.

Run service password-encryption to hide passwords from casual viewing.

Always save your configuration after making changes:

Use copy running-config startup-config or write

Know how to navigate back and exit:

Use exit to step back

Use end or CTRL+Z to exit completely
