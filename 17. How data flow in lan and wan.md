🏢 Network Overview (Your Scenario)
📍Branch 1:
25 PCs (PC1 to PC25) connected to Switch 1

Switch 1 connected to Router 1

Router 1 connects to Router 2, then to Router 3

Router 3 connects to Switch 2 (also in Branch 1)

Possibly: Router 3 might be a connection point to Branch 2 or internal second LAN in Branch 1

📍Branch 2:
25 PCs (PC26 to PC50) connected to Switch 3

Switch 3 connects to Router 4 (or maybe Router 3 if connected via WAN)

Let’s assume:

Routers are connected via Serial/WAN links

Switches are Layer 2 devices

Routers perform routing (Layer 3)

🧪 CASE 1: PC1 sends data to PC25 (same LAN)
✅ What’s happening?
Both PCs are in the same subnet

Both are connected to Switch 1 (Layer 2 device)

📶 Step-by-step flow:
PC1 checks PC25’s IP address — it realizes PC25 is in the same subnet.

PC1 looks in its ARP cache:

If PC25’s MAC is found → move to step 4

If not → PC1 sends ARP Request (Who has IP of PC25?)

PC25 replies with its MAC address

PC1 sends data frame directly to PC25’s MAC through Switch 1

Switch forwards the frame using its MAC table

✅ No router is involved — only Layer 2 switching
✅ This is called intra-network communication

🧪 CASE 2: PC1 sends data to PC50 (remote LAN, via WAN)
✅ What’s happening?
PC1 and PC50 are in different subnets

So, data must go through routers (Layer 3)

📶 Step-by-step flow:
PC1 checks destination IP (PC50) and sees it's not in the same subnet

PC1 sends the packet to its default gateway → Router 1

PC1 does ARP to find Router 1’s MAC address

PC1 sends the data packet to Router 1

Router 1 checks its routing table

Destination: 192.168.2.0/24 (or subnet where PC50 lives)

Finds next hop → Router 2

Router 1 forwards the packet to Router 2 via WAN link (serial)

Router 2 forwards it to Router 3 (final router before target LAN)

Router 3 checks routing table

Destination matches directly connected LAN (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24)

Router 3 sends packet to Switch 3

Switch 3 forwards it to PC50 using MAC address

PC50 receives the packet

✅ This is inter-network communication (Layer 3 routing)

🔄 Summary of Differences

| Action      | PC1 to PC25 (LAN)   | PC1 to PC50 (WAN)                  |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Subnet      | Same                | Different                          |
| Uses ARP    | Yes                 | Yes (only to find gateway MAC)     |
| Uses switch | Yes                 | Yes (at destination too)           |
| Uses router | No                  | Yes (Router1 → Router2 → Router3)  |
| Layer       | Layer 2             | Layer 3                            |
| Path        | PC1 → Switch → PC25 | PC1 → R1 → R2 → R3 → Switch → PC50 |


🧠 Notes:
ARP is used to find MAC addresses of devices in the same subnet.

Routers route packets across different networks/subnets.

Switches only work within the same broadcast domain.

📌 Bonus Tip:
If you want to test this on Packet Tracer or GNS3:

Assign IPs to each interface

Use different subnets for each LAN

Configure static routing or dynamic routing between routers.
