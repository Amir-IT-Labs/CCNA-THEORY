# BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter

---

## PortFast Reminder
PortFast makes a port start in the **forwarding** state immediately when it is connected, but **it does not disable STP** on the port.

- The port continues to send BPDUs every 2 seconds.
- Because end hosts don’t run STP and don’t send BPDUs, a PortFast-enabled port should **not receive BPDUs**.
- But what if it does?

If a PortFast-enabled port receives a BPDU:
- It will revert to acting like a regular STP port (without PortFast).
- PortFast should only be enabled on ports connected to non-switch devices (like routers or end hosts).
- These devices do **not** send BPDUs.

If an end user carelessly connects a **switch** to a port meant for end hosts, it could **affect the STP topology**.

That’s where **BPDU Guard** comes in.

---

## BPDU Guard
BPDU Guard **automatically disables a port** if it receives a BPDU, protecting the STP topology by preventing **unauthorized devices** from becoming part of the network.

- BPDU Guard protects the network from unauthorized switches being connected to ports intended for end hosts.
- It can be configured separately from PortFast, but both features are usually used together.
- A BPDU Guard-enabled port continues to **send** BPDUs, but if it **receives** a BPDU, it enters the **err-disabled** state.  
- In effect, this disables the port.

---

## Configuring BPDU Guard

Like PortFast, it can be configured in two ways:

**Per-Port:**
```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

**Default (Global):**
```bash
SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
```

- When enabled by default, BPDU Guard is activated **only** on PortFast-enabled ports, not all access ports.
- To disable BPDU Guard on a specific port:
```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard disable
```

## Errdisable
**Errdisable** is a Cisco feature that disables a port under certain conditions, such as a BPDU Guard violation.

To re-enable an err-disabled port:
1. **Manually** use:
   ```bash
   shutdown
   no shutdown
   ```
2. **Automatically** using:
   ```bash
   errdisable recovery
   ```

To see details:
```bash
SW1# show errdisable recovery
```

By default, recovery will take **5 minutes** (300 seconds), but this can be changed:

```bash
SW1(config)# errdisable recovery interval <seconds>
```

To enable recovery for a specific cause (e.g., BPDU Guard):
```bash
SW1(config)# errdisable recovery cause bpduguard
SW1(config)# do show errdisable recovery
```

## BPDU Filter
A switch port connected to an end host continues sending BPDUs every 2 seconds, regardless of whether PortFast and/or BPDU Guard are enabled.

If the port is not connected to another switch, sending BPDUs is unnecessary and may even be undesirable:

1. It uses a small amount of bandwidth and processing power.
2. BPDUs contain information about the VLAN's STP topology. If maximum security is a concern, avoid sending this info to user devices.

BPDU Filter **prevents a port from sending BPDUs**.

> **Unlike BPDU Guard, BPDU Filter does NOT disable the port if it receives a BPDU.**

---

## Configuring BPDU Filter

**Per-Port:**
```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
```
- The port will NOT send BPDUs.
- The port will IGNORE any BPDUs it receives.
- In effect, this disables STP on the port.  
  > **Use with caution!**

**Default (Global):**
```bash
SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
```
- BPDU Filter will be activated on all PortFast-enabled ports.
- To disable BPDU Filter on a specific port:
```bash
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpdufilter disable
```
- The port will NOT send BPDUs.
- If it receives a BPDU:
  - PortFast and BPDU Filter are **disabled**.
  - The port operates as a **normal STP port**.

---

## Recommendations
- Enable **PortFast** and **BPDU Guard** however you prefer (per-port or globally).
- Only enable **BPDU Filter** by default (global configuration).
  > Unless you have a specific reason to enable it per-port, avoid using per-port BPDU Filter.

---

## Important Note

**If BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter are enabled on the same port at the same time:**

1. **BPDU Filter enabled globally**:
   - If the port receives a BPDU:
     - BPDU Filter is disabled.
     - **BPDU Guard is triggered** → Port is **err-disabled**.

2. **BPDU Filter enabled per-port**:
   - If the port receives a BPDU:
     - The BPDU is **ignored**.
     - BPDU Guard is **not triggered**.
