# üîÑ VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

## üìò Overview

VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) allows you to configure VLANs on a central **VTP Server** switch, and other switches (**VTP Clients**) will **synchronize their VLAN database** to the server.

It is designed for **large networks** with many VLANs, so you don't have to manually configure each VLAN on every switch.

## üîÅ VTP Domain Behavior

- If a switch without a domain name receives an advertisement with a VTP domain name, it will **automatically join** the VTP domain.
- If a switch receives a **VTP advertisement** in the same domain with a **higher revision number**, it will **update its VLAN database** to match.
- Changing the VTP domain to an unused domain name will **reset the revision number to 0**.
- Changing VTP mode to **transparent** will also **reset the revision number to 0**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VTP Risk

**One danger of VTP:**

If you connect an **old switch with a higher revision number** to your network (and the VTP domain name matches),  
all switches in the domain will **synchronize their VLAN database** to that switch.  
This can cause all hosts on your network to **instantly lose connectivity** because switches may sync to a **different VLAN database**.  
The VLAN you are using can disappear.  
> This is one reason VTP is **not used in modern networks**.

## üî¢ VTP Versions

There are **3 versions** of VTP:
- **VTP Version 1**
- **VTP Version 2**
- **VTP Version 3**

### ‚ùå VLAN Range Support

- **VTP v1/v2**: Do **not support** extended VLAN range (1006‚Äì4094).
- **VTP v3**: Fully **supports extended VLAN range**.

### üÜö VTP v1 vs v2

- Not much different.
- **VTP v2** adds **support for Token Ring VLANs**.
- If you use Token Ring VLANs, you **must enable VTP v2**.
- Otherwise, there‚Äôs **no reason to use VTP v2** over v1.

### üîß Set VTP Version

```bash
vtp version 1
vtp version 2
vtp version 3
```

---

## üîç VTP Show and Set Commands

- To **show VTP status**:
```bash
show vtp status
```

- To **set VTP domain name**:
```bash
vtp domain [name]
```

> Most **modern Cisco switches** support all 3 versions, but older switches may only support versions 1 and 2.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è VTP Modes

There are **3 VTP modes**:
1. **Server**
2. **Client**
3. **Transparent**

> Cisco switches operate in **VTP Server mode by default**.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è VTP Server Mode

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  vtp mode server
  ```
- Can **add/modify/delete VLANs**
- Stores VLAN database in **NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM)**
- Increases **revision number** every time a VLAN is changed
- Advertises the **latest VLAN database** on trunk interfaces
- VTP servers also function as **clients**
- A server will **synchronize** to another VTP server with a **higher revision number**

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª VTP Client Mode

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  vtp mode client
  ```
- Cannot **add/modify/delete VLANs**
- CLI commands to change VLANs are **rejected**
- Does **not store VLAN database in NVRAM** (except in VTP v3, which allows it)
- Synchronizes VLAN database from the **server with the highest revision number**
- **Forwards** VTP advertisements to other clients over trunk ports

---

### üïµÔ∏è VTP Transparent Mode

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  vtp mode transparent
  ```
- Does **not participate** in the VTP domain (does not sync VLAN database)
- Maintains its **own independent VLAN database** in NVRAM
- Can **add/modify/delete VLANs**, but these **won‚Äôt be advertised** to other switches
- **Forwards** VTP advertisements in the same domain
- **Does not advertise** its own VLAN database
